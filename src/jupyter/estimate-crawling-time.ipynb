DENSE FOG ACROSS CENTRAL AND EAST-CENTRAL WISCONSIN THIS MORNING... THEN A MAJOR SPRING STORM SYSTEM EXPECTED TO BRING A VARIETY OF WEATHER TO THE AREA THROUGH THIS WEEKEND... Lingering moisture from overnight rains was combining with diminishing winds to allow dense fog to form over portions of central and east-central Wisconsin this morning. The visibility could drop to less than 1/4 mile at times, leading to hazardous travel conditions. Morning commuters in central and east-central Wisconsin should plan to encounter areas of greatly restricted visibility, and allow extra travel time for the trip to work or school. Always use low-beam headlights when driving in fog. A strong storm system is forecast to affect the area from late tonight through the upcoming weekend, bringing periods of snow, freezing rain, sleet, and strong gusty winds. Although light snow accumulations may begin to occur over northern Wisconsin late tonight and on Friday, the most significant snow and ice accumulations are anticipated from Friday night into Sunday night. Rain will begin in central and east-central Wisconsin tonight. The precipitation will expand into the north late tonight and on Friday, where it will fall as a mix of snow, sleet, and freezing rain. As colder air is drawn southward across the area, the rain over central and east-central Wisconsin will change to freezing rain and sleet. The precipitation across the entire area will eventually change to all snow. The timing of the changeover of precipitation types is critical to determining snowfall totals and the amount of ice build up that occurs due to freezing rain, and remains very uncertain this far in advance. In addition to all the precipitation, strong northeast winds will develop on Friday and continue through the weekend. Wind gusts of 30 to 40 mph are likely across the area at times. Gusts around 50 mph are possible near the Lake and Bay in east-central Wisconsin. Hazardous travel conditions are expected develop Friday night and continue through the weekend. Travel could become very difficult at times. Ice shoves and localized flooding may occur along the shoreline of the Bay of Green Bay. The ice and strong northeast winds may impede the flow of water from the Fox River into the Bay of Green Bay, leading to rising water levels near the mouth of the Fox River. Anyone with travel plans this weekend should closely monitor later forecasts for updated information. $$ Skowronski Special Weather Statement National Weather Service Jacksonville FL 750 AM EDT Thu Apr 12 2018 GAZ134>136-151>154-165-166-121330- Bacon-Appling-Wayne-Pierce-Brantley-Inland Glynn-Coastal Glynn- Inland Camden-Coastal Camden- Including the cities of Alma, New Lacy, Baxley, Pine Grove, Plant Hatch, Doctortown, Gardi, Jesup, Blackshear, Atkinson, Hickox, Hortense, Nahunta, Raybon, Waynesville, Hoboken, Thalmann, Jekyll Island, Glynn Haven, Sea Island, St. Simons, Country Club Estate, Dock Junction, Colesburg, Tarboro, Waverly, Woodbine, Dover Bluff, Kingsland, and Dungeness 750 AM EDT Thu Apr 12 2018 ...

SUNDAY AND MONDAY... No Hazards. TUESDAY... Very High Fire Weather Potential... High Wind Potential. EXTENDED DISCUSSION... Similar wind conditions will develop Thursday, although minimum relative humidities will be slightly higher in the 35 to 55 percent range. The higher relative humidities will lead to a slight decrease in the fire weather conditions. On Friday, a strong storm system will move into the Plains region, leading to an increase in the severe thunderstorm potential, as well as continued elevated fire weather conditions. Thunderstorm chances will begin Thursday night and increase further during the day Friday as a cold front and dryline approach from the west. Strong to severe thunderstorms should develop by early to mid afternoon Friday, well ahead of the surface boundaries. Additional development may occur on the dryline by late afternoon and into the evening hours. Storms along the dryline will have the potential to become supercells with the threat for baseball size hail, damaging winds, and possibly, a few tornadoes. The greatest potential continues to be across far Eastern Oklahoma and also Northwest Arkansas. The severe weather threat will shift east of the region shortly after midnight. In addition to the severe weather potential on Friday, elevated fire weather conditions will develop behind the dryline mid to late afternoon Friday as much drier air and gusty southwest winds move into portions of Northeast Oklahoma. Areas along and west of Highway 75 will be most likely to see elevated conditions. Continued windy and much cooler conditions will move in for the weekend behind the cold frontal passage Friday night and into Saturday. EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLANNING STATEMENT... Emergency management and first responders should continue to monitor both the fire weather conditions and the severe weather potential through the end of this week and continue preparations to respond to both potential threats. weather.gov/tulsa contains additional information. $$Hazardous Weather Outlook National Weather Service Eureka CA 705 PM PDT Wed Apr 11 2018 CAZ101-103-130215- Coastal Del Norte-Northern Humboldt Coast- 705 PM PDT Wed Apr 11 2018 This hazardous weather outlook is for northwest California. .

      "  \"contents\" : \"Hyphenating Your Last Name After Marriage 648 Comments Congratulations on deciding to get married! You are in for… okay, we can't lie. While being married is great and wonderful, the act of getting married can be quite stressful. There is the planning of the ceremony itself, the merging of two households (if you don't already live together) and all of the details involved with that. You also have to take the time to apply for your marriage license and then decide whether or not you are going to keep your name or change it. If you've made up your mind and would like to hyphenate your name online, you can use our name change application to complete the necessary forms. This is where a lot of people have trouble. Once upon a time, it was just customary for a Bride to take her Groom's last name as her own and abandon her maiden name completely. The act of keeping her own name was considered taboo and people's eyebrows would raise right off their faces when they found out that the Bride was even considering something so radical. Over time, though, more and more women are deciding to keep their names. There are a lot of reasons to want to keep your own name. Hopefully you have a supportive Groom who understands why this idea is the most appealing to you. A lot of times, though, the act of keeping your name is still something that causes concern… even if your Groom is fine with it, his family (or your own) might not be so understanding. There are a couple of ways to compromise on the whole \\\"you wanting to keep your name and your Groom hating the idea\\\" problem. You could choose an entirely new last name for the two of you to share. This way neither of you gets \\\"your\\\" way and you both have to deal with the legalities of going through a name change. Most of the time, though, the most popular compromise is to hyphenate your last name and the last name of your Groom. For example, if your Groom's name is John Smith and your name is Kate Jones, you would name yourself Kate Jones-Smith or Kate Smith-Jones. This allows you to keep going by your own last name while legally adopting your husband's surname at the same time. Why Is Hyphenation a Good Thing? The compromise is the biggest reason that so many women choose to hyphenate their last names. It is a way of you keeping your own identity while also keeping your future husband happy It allows you to stay connected to accomplishments that you achieved before you got married. For example, many women who choose to hyphenate do so partially because they have earned higher educational degrees and certifications under their maiden names. They might have also had things published or publicized and want to stay connected to that identity. It helps you stay obviously connected to your children whose names might not be hyphenated and who have been given your husband's surname. It can help you bridge the gap between your personal and professional life. Many women who opt to simply keep their own names do so because they don't want to give up all that they have accomplished professionally. Unfortunately this makes it hard for them to claim ownership of these accomplishments personally because they happened under their \\\"other\\\" name. Nobody wants to think about the negative stuff but, with the divorce statistics being what they are, you might want a contingency plan. Changing your name to his last name and then back to your own if things go south will be a major hassle. While tradition is one thing, there isn't any logical reason—at least one that isn't rooted in \\\"because that's how it has always been done\\\" to completely change your name. Keeping your name and joining it to your husband's through hyphenation is as legal as simply adopting his name or as simply keeping your own and leaving his out of the picture entirely. Probably the most important reason to consider hyphenation is your identity. You've spent your whole life building your identity under a certain name. Obviously you will still be you even if you've taken on your husband's last name and omitted yours entirely. At the same time, your name is associated with the identity you've built up and hyphenation allows you to respect that while also respecting tradition and your husband's family's identity at the same time. Why Might Hyphenation Be a Bad Thing? Hyphenated names are more difficult for computers to handle. When you type in your personal information, the hyphen often isn't recognized by the computer's code. This means that you have to eliminate the hyphen and that can cause problems later on. If you care about outside opinions on your name, you should know that a large portion of today's society is annoyed by the hyphenated name. Some people find it \\\"snobby\\\" and others simply find it irritating because they have a hard time remembering which last name they are supposed to say first. Some people even believe that not simply adopting your husband's last name is a huge sign of disrespect and a lack of commitment. It is possible that your future husband will find this choice offensive. Some men, regardless of how you might feel about such things, are traditionalists and feel that it is simply \\\"right\\\" for the woman to take the man's last name as her own. Whether or not your future husband insisting on your adopting his last name is a red flag to you or not, it is still something that you should take under consideration. Some people worry that having a hyphenated name—if you do not plan on passing the hyphenation down to your children and are planning on giving them only your husband's surname—can be confusing for a child. Even when the child is given a hyphenated last name, they might be confused when they get older when they start making friends whose names aren't hyphenated. Interesting Statistics and Hyphenation Stories Instances of today's generation of women hyphenating their names has gotten significantly smaller since the baby-boomers' generation started making the practice more popular. The Knot website says that less than 10% of women today hyphenate their names. Some simply choose to have two last names or two middle names when they want to keep their own last names after they get married. Same-sex couples sometimes have a difficult time trying to hyphenate or change their surnames after they are married. Even when they are married legally, there are some states in which the judges who hear these petitions will deny the peoples' request to have the same last name. In some cases, applicants sometimes fib about the reason they are seeking the name change. What It All Boils Down To There are all sorts of reasons to hyphenate your name and not to hyphenate your name. The basis for each of these things, however, is whether or not you are willing to make a compromise when it comes to changing your name (or whether you are willing to compromise on your future spouse adopting your name as their own). The hyphenation is the epitome of a compromise. One spouse wants a complete name change. The other spouse wants no name change. Hyphenating the two names is a way for each person to, at least a little bit, \\\"win\\\" the argument. Of course this isn't the actual end of the argument. Why would you ever think that anything having to do with getting married would be that easy? Once the decision to hyphenate one person's name is made, you have to decide whether both of you are going to hyphenate your surname. After all, why should the bride be the only one to go through the name change process? Equal partners and opportunities and all that, right? Many men, when they acquiesce to a bride's compromise on hyphenating her surname are happy to do the hyphenation as well. There are always going to be a few exceptions to the rule but we're willing to bet that most men will say \\\"okay, if you will, I will too.\\\" From here, then, you need to decide which name is going to come first in the hyphenation. The decisions and compromises just don't ever end, do they? And don't forget the legal stuff! Making the decision is just part of the process. From there you are going to have to legally change your name all over the place. You'll need to change your name at the bank, with social security, with your credit cards, on your driver's license, at the gym… everywhere. It's easy to get overwhelmed just thinking about it. The good news here, however, is that there are tools you can use to help you make the process a little bit less scary and intricate. What matters of course, is that the two of you are going to be happily married—hopefully for the rest of your lives. At the end of the day, whether you each keep your names, whether you come up with an entirely new name for the two of you to share or whether you hyphenate your current surnames, what matters is that you love each other and are going to be joining your lives together. Try to remember that as you are staring at the application for your marriage license and filling out the portion that reads \\\"name after you get married\\\" (or whatever the legalese for that might be). That's what matters most of all, right?648 Comments Comments Navigation…← Previous 1 2 3 4Gary Philpott May 17, 2016Hi. I am Irish and got married to my American wife. I am filling out my Green Card forms. On our marriage cert she changed her name to hyphenated Acevedo-Philpott. Her Drivers license now says Acevedo-Philpott but her SSN and Passport still say Acevedo. When filling out the forms it asks for my Wife's Family name . Would this be Acevedo or Acevedo-Philpott? Thanks in advance. Gary Reply Valera May 18, 2016Hi Gary. Generally, it's the name that's on the social, so Acevedo. Reply Isabella May 20, 2016Hello,I am a resident of Arizona, was married there in 2015 and kept my maiden name. I would like to add my husbands name and would like advice which option is the easiest in terms of legal paperwork. Option A: I do not have a middle name. So, this option I would my my maiden name my middle name and take my husbands last name. Option B: Hyphenate Thank you Reply Valera May 20, 2016Hi Isabella. Option B (hyphenate) shouldn't pose a problem. Option A might give you difficulty due to your not having an existing middle name. You can contact your driver's license office to confirm if a new middle would be honored. Reply Michelle Ware May 22, 2016I changed my name 10 years ago to my husband last name. Now, I would like to hyphenate it. How hard will this process be? Reply Valera May 24, 2016Hi Michelle. Not hard. You'll just have to go to court to do it. Reply Lindsay June 27, 2016I live in New Hampshire and got married last month. On the marriage license I changed my name to his last name. Now I've decided to hyphenate instead. Will I need a court order to do so? Reply Valera June 30, 2016Hi Lindsay. It's likely that you will. Many of the town/city clerks use a universal application which details this in the fine print area of the worksheet. Reply Irene June 30, 2016Hi Valera,Your article as well as the Q&A section has been very informative. This is something I didn't even think about until I read all the comments. I just got married 3 weeks ago. I didn't even want to worry about changing my name until after the honeymoon since all the travel arrangements have been made in my maiden name. So naturally the marriage certificate is also in my maiden name. Now I'm starting to do the research and see the options of changing my name to my husband's. Does this mean I first have to get the name changed to his on the marriage certificate? Since it looks like I'll need copies of the marriage certificate for various forms for the name change? How would this work? Thank you! !Reply Valera June 30, 2016Hi Irene. It depends on the state and whether the new name specified—or not specified—will be a hindrance when attempting to undergo a marriage based name change. Some states want the name on the certificate to match what you'll change it to, otherwise they'll require a court order to process it. Some states don't even have a space on the marriage license to specify a name change. So, it depends. One thing that's for certain is that changing a marriage certificate, after the fact, is unlikely to be accepted by the recorder's office unless there was a mistake made on their part. Reply Teresa July 4, 2016Hi,Valera. Thanks for the great article. It was very informative but I still have a question. The last name on my birth certificate is P**y and my married last name is H***d. The last time I petitioned the court for a name change was after the divorce from my first husband. I petitioned to drop his last name and just keep my birth name. I have lost my ss card so I am not really sure what is has on it. Not even really sure what is on my marriage certificate but I assume it is H***d. We married in Alabama but were born in and reside in Kentucky. I have been signing my name like my birth last name is a middle initial (Teresa P. H***d) but now I want my last name to be P**y H***d (Teresa P**y H***d). So, can I just sign my name the way I want or do I have to petition the court? It just seems superfluous to ask a court if I can keep and sign a name I was born with. Suggestions? Thanks in advance. Reply Valera July 5, 2016Hi Teresa. You can sign it however you'd prefer, but keep context in mind. If you're applying for a loan, filling out government paperwork, filing taxes, applying for a job (think background check), or anything else that would entail looking up your legal name to confirm that it matches what's on file with the SSA, you'll need to sign your actual, current, legal name. But, for other informal situations, sign it how you'd prefer. Replybrittany lemonda July 5, 2016Hello. I am having some wet feet changing my name to be hyphenated. I am a clinical psychologist and want to keep my maiden name professionally and want my license, board certification etc. to be in my maiden name. If i change my name legally can I keep my maiden name professionally for everything? Reply Valera July 7, 2016Hi Brittany. That would be up to the state board. You'll have to consult them to determine if you need to 1) notify them of a name change, 2) have their internal records updated, and 3) require the reissue of documents reflecting your legal name, or if you can continue using your maiden name. Some have standards in place where they need to be notified of a name change, while it still being permissible for you to continue using a maiden or prior name. Replyvane July 5, 2016Hi I am getting married in the next few days. Am I able to hyphenate his last name after my last name? Example my last name is Rangel, my fiancés last name is Padilla, so could it be Rangel-Padilla? If so, do I still have to update my ID's or is that optional. Reply Valera July 7, 2016Hi Vane. That shouldn't be a problem. If you're only changing your name on your marriage certificate/license, but not on any actual documents, then your name wouldn't actually change. So, in that instance, it is optional. Reply Iris July 13, 2016What count is your social and it matches your ID/DL. Reply Iris July 13, 2016I divorced several, almost 6yrs ago. I never found the need to change my married last name. Until just recently. I am expecting a new baby out of wedlock. Therefore, I felt the need to change my married last name back to my maiden name. Now I don't know whether or not to hyphanate my maiden name and my son's father's last name? #Last Name#New Baby#Complicated? Reply JJJuly 18, 2016Thank you Valera for the very helpful information and answers to the comments. So I just want to confirm that I'm understanding some things: If you change your last name (completely or hyphenated) on your marriage license, that gives you the ability to change your other legal documents and without fees? However, if you change it on your marriage license and don't follow up and change it with your SS or DL, then you can still go by your maiden name legally and \\\"new\\\" last name socially? How does the marriage license validity or use if the \\\"new\\\" last name isn't adopted? Would it be wrong/illegal to complete things like customs forms with the \\\"new\\\" last name if it's only listed on the marriage license? I'm from NYC by the way and would really like a 2 word last name (mine his) without the hyphenation, but not sure NY allows that.. I am also on the same boat as others with professional documents that I would prefer not to change. I just get worried about things like having children and their last name being different that mine. I've been very conflicted. Thanks so much for your clarifications and help!Reply Valera July 21, 2016If you change your last name (completely or hyphenated) on your marriage license, that gives you the ability to change your other legal documents and without fees?

Yes. How does the marriage license validity or use if the \\\"new\\\" last name isn't adopted? Let's make sure we're discussing the same thing. The marriage license is what you'll get prior to marriage. The marriage certificate is what you'll get after you are married. In some states it's the same document; the status is what changes. With that said, whether or not you change your name won't affect its validity. Would it be wrong/illegal to complete things like customs forms with the \\\"new\\\" last name if it's only listed on the marriage license? Yes, use your legal maiden name. I'm from NYC by the way and would really like a 2 word last name (mine his) without the hyphenation, but not sure NY allows that I don't believe that's allowed in New York. Reply JJJuly 28, 2016Thanks so much for your reply and clarifications!Ok so on the marriage license you need to put what you would like to change it to and the marriage certificate is when it's actually changed? If I write a new last name on the certificate, will I then be expected to change my other formal documents? Will it be an issue if I don't? Thank you for clarifying between the certificate and the license. Reply Valera July 28, 2016Ok so on the marriage license you need to put what you would like to change it to and the marriage certificate is when it's actually changed? Your marriage certificate will mirror what you specify on your marriage license. It's not changeable. If I write a new last name on the certificate, will I then be expected to change my other formal documents? You certificate wouldn't deviate from what you specify on your license. And, no, you wouldn't be expected or obligated to change any of your documents to reflect the name on your certificate. Will it be an issue if I don't? No, if you ultimately decide not to change your name, just ignore what you specified on your marriage ceritifcate. Thank you for clarifying between the certificate and the license. You're welcome. Reply Honey July 28, 2016I have been using my married name for my drivers license but it's not hyphened which I recently got a car. Now my license is about to expire. But on my ssc is my hyphenated married name. Do I have to call the dealer to hyphenate the info or registration, bank, etc. since everything just in my non hyphenated name but the first name chose I had. I honestly liked it when I just had his last name only & not hyphenated lol. So how can I just keep everything as it is? Thanks Reply Valera July 28, 2016I honestly liked it when I just had his last name only & not hyphenated lol. So how can I just keep everything as it is? If you want to shift to hyphenated (even though you stated you prefer the non-hyphenated variant), you'll need to have your SS card updated. They've already changed it, due to marriage, to a hyphenated version. To change it again, they'll need another document showing a new name change. You couldn't use your marriage certificate again. You could fulfill this requirement with a court order document. If you want your last name to be married only (not hyphen), then you have to deal with your current name mismatch. When it's time for you to renew your license, the DMV may query the SSA database, which'll return a name mismatch. In those instances, they'll want to go with the name that's on your social security record, with a supporting document (e.g., certified marriage certificate, certified divorce decree, court order) showing your name change event. Without that, they may not change your name. When it comes time to deal with third-party organizations (e.g., banks, dealers) you'll need to have your name choice sorted, then bring to them the document showing your name change event, be it a marriage certificate or court order. Reply Honey July 28, 2016Wow! Thanks so much. I got more detail from you than everyone else. You are awesome. Now I know what I have to do & thanks again. Reply MACBAugust 10, 2016I've been married for two months and I want to add my husbands last name legally. However, my husband recently decided he also wants to change his last name to his mom's maiden name due to personal reasons. So, our marriage license is Under John Perez and Arely Basurto and he wants to change his name to John Estrada, and I would change mine to Basurto-Estrada. Is it possible after marriage, and do you think that would be complicated when we have kids ( we want hyphenated Estrada-Basurto) , or should we be consistent and all change our last names to Estrada -Basurto so it's a consistent and the same for the whole the family? Reply Valera August 15, 2016Hi MACB. It can vary by state. Some require the name on the marriage certificate match what you intend to change it to. If it doesn't, name changes won't go through without going another route, such as getting a court order. Other states may not have this requirement. It's hard to say without knowing where you reside. As for confusion for your future kids having a reversed name sequence, I can certainly see where that'll come up. At first glance it can look like a typo. If you go that route, you should prepare to issue corrections from time to time. Still, if that's what you prefer, there's no compelling reason to go against it.

I'm considering changing or hyphonating my last name. I was previously divorced and purchased a home with my ex under my maiden name (it was prior to our marriage). This home was affected by a hurricane and I'm still trying to get rid of the property (maiden name). Also, I've been a teacher for 15 years and I'm not really interested in changing it due to my teaching Liscense and reputation in the school. Would changing to my new married name affect my insurance? What do you suggest doing that would be best for these situations. My husband is not a fan of hyphonating and would like for me to change it to his. He's very traditional, but I'm concerned it will just be a headache if it's fully changed to a totally new name without a connection with my maiden name. We do not have children yet but hopefully soon. Thank you in advance!Reply Valera September 14, 2016Would changing to my new married name affect my insurance? If you're changing your name, it's a good idea to notify your insurance company of it.but I'm concerned it will just be a headache if it's fully changed to a totally new name without a connection with my maiden name. Whether you choose to hyphenate or just take your husband's last name, will have the same level of simplicty or ease. The name changing process is the same for both. There's no right or wrong in this situation, it's a matter of personal choice. If you'd prefer to maintain a connection to your maiden, you may want to consider a middle name to maiden change, or using whichever name combination informally until you ultimately come down to a final decision to change (or not change) it for real.

Reply SBROctober 5, 2016Hi,Thank you for your article! I made the decision to hyphenate my name as I wanted to keep my maiden name, but also have the same last name as my husband and future children. So in essence I wanted my legal last name to be changed to Maiden-Married. Currently I am struggling to change my name legally. I came across your article when I searched \\\"Husband Two Last Names\\\". I tried to read through as many comments as I could in order to see if someone else had asked my question but I did not find one similar to mine. Well here is my predicament: I mailed in my application and marriage certificate to the Social Security Administration. They went ahead and changed my last name to what I requested Maiden-Married. Then I went to the DMV (I live in the state of Florida) to update my drivers license and they refused to change my name to what is currently printed on my Social Security Card. You see my husband is not a U. S. Citizen, on his birth certificate, his countries passport, and on his U. S. legal residence documents his name is his first name, paternal last name, followed by his maternal last name (so for this example I will use John Smith Taylor). When we got married four years ago on the marriage certificate they used the name to match his ID therefore, it appears as John Smith Taylor. Because of this the DMV is telling me that I HAVE to take both his paternal and maternal last name. Therefore making my name either Jane Doe-Smith Taylor if I want to hyphenate, or I can opt not to hyphenate, and then be Jane Smith Taylor. I called the DMV office in Tallahassee and they told me to go back to the DMV and show my husbands ID's showing only his paternal last name, but he does not have any ID's showing only his paternal last name. His ID's all match his birth certificate which have both his paternal and maternal last name. This means that if I choose to take my husbands last name am I forced to take BOTH his paternal and maternal last name. This makes NO SENSE. I was born in Puerto Rico, which is also a Spanish speaking country. My birth certificate has both my fathers last name and my mothers last name, but living outside of Puerto Rico I have only ever been required to use my paternal last name. My current drivers license is Jane Doe (with only my paternal last name). I really do not know what to do at this point. I am being forced into keeping my maiden name because the alternative is to add my husbands paternal AND maternal last name and I don't want his mothers last name. That's not his family name. When we have kids, the kids will take his paternal last name, not his paternal and maternal last name. With the amount of Latinos living in the United States one would think they would have a precedent and guidelines on how to go about changing married names that did not require picking up both your spouses last names. Help Please!Reply Valera October 8, 2016Hi SBR. It is frustrating, but the state DMV is often stricter than federal institutions. They see your husband's last name as \\\"maternal last paternal last.\\\" They won't separate it unless you can provide them satisfactory documentation showing it's not one name. If they're unwilling to budge, as appears to be the case, you can either try another agent/office, or obtain a court order to reflect your preferred name.

Reply Valera October 18, 2016Hi Jerrie. You wouldn't be able to go back to the SS and change your name again without another document showing a new name change event. You wouldn't be able to use your marriage certificate as it's a one time only deal. You can either get a court petitioned name change, or look into remarriage through a civil ceremony to have an updated marriage certificate issued.

Love to hear input on this one. Thoughts? Reply Valera November 17, 2016Should I hyphenate the Brown-Bergeron or just go ahead and drop Brown (Katherine Jean Bergeron)Either of these would be recognized and allowed as part of a marriage-related name change. Neither is superior over the other. Simply choose whichever you'd prefer.or I can request to drop Jean, so that would be Katherine Brown Bergeron? If you're looking to drop your middle name so that you'll no longer have a middle name, well that option may not even be recognized. If you're looking to swap your middle name with your maiden, well then that's recognized. It'll look the same written out, but your legal surname would just be Bergeron.

I would like to keep my full name \\\"first middle last\\\" and add his name on as a 4th name. My question is deciding whether I have two middle names or two last names. My preference would be two middle names so that there is less confusion surround what my last name is, but I would still like to go by Dr. Maiden name. And for the most part I would go by first name maiden name (aka 2nd middle name) last. As an example say my name now is Mary Louise Smith — I would like to officially become Mary Louise Smith Johns — with smith technically as a 2nd middle name– but at work go by Mary Louise Smith and Dr. Smith but in most day to day go by Dr Mary Smith Johns or just Mary Johns. Could I do that if my maiden name is technically in the middle name box and not last name box? The board licensing says as long as your boarded name is still part of your name it is fine, but I am wondering about how much of a problem that will pose and if that realistically seems doable.

Unless there something on your certificate that specifies the field types (e.g., first name, last name) then it seems you're describing an actual error on your license. I say license, but is that really the document we're discussing? Is the mistake on your marriage license, or your marriage certificate/record? Regardless of what the document is, you can contact the issuing office and try to get the mistake corrected, document amended, then reissued.

He uses his first last name \\\"A\\\" when he introduces himself and only uses the double last name \\\"A-B\\\" for legal documents.

For your middle name swap, consult the middle to maiden page to see if that's allowed in your state. Specifically the last two paragraphs. As for your children, you can name them whatever you'd like. They don't have to match your last name. You can apply any hyphenated variation.

I just don't know what my options are…. Reply Valera June 19, 2017Hi Kayla. I don't believe the space option is possible without a court order. Hyphenation is possible without a court order. Have you considered replacing your middle name with your maiden name? Reply Sally June 15, 2017We are having trouble working out what way sounds better Pearce-Benning or Benning-Pearce!!!

Reply Beth Cyr June 21, 2017I got married recently in GA (and live in GA). I want to hyphenate my last name to Cyr-Kroh. I did so with the SSA with no problem. I went to get my drivers license changed and they wouldn't hyphenate it so now my license says Cyr Kroh. At the dmv they said the marriage certificate had to have it exactly how it would go on my license. I was concerned about this and had previously gone to the probate court and asked them if I needed to get a marriage certificate with the new hyphenated last name and they said no. it was fine how it was. So now I'm really confused. Most other name change things use your license for verification… does the hyphen matter? Can I just hyphenate it anyway even if it isn't that way on my license? Should I go back to the SSA and redo it so it doesn't have a hyphen? To add to the mix – I'm planning on moving to another state in a few months and am concerned about what might happen when I get a new license. Reply Valera June 22, 2017I was concerned about this and had previously gone to the probate court and asked them if I needed to get a marriage certificate with the new hyphenated last name and they said no. it was fine how it was. But it's not fine from the DDS' perspective. Have you inquired about getting your certificate amended, as unlikely as that may be? Can I just hyphenate it anyway even if it isn't that way on my license? It depends on the institution. Some may accept it, some may not. Should I go back to the SSA and redo it so it doesn't have a hyphen? It's doubtful they'll process another name change using your same marriage certificate. To add to the mix – I'm planning on moving to another state in a few months and am concerned about what might happen when I get a new license. A new license from Georgia or the other state? The other state will be governed by their state's regulations and not Georgia's. Reply Tiffany FJune 27, 2017Hi, I am currently filling out my marriage license and have a few questions. 1) when I hyphenate my name can I keep my maiden name as is on my SS card and all other documents that require my SS number? 2) If I change my name on my SS card as my hyphen name do I have to change it at the DMV, taxes and etc…? 3) If I get married now, but wait a few years to change my name on my SS card as my hyphenate name, because I want to have a child and my family all have the same name can I do so? 4) When you get a marriage certificate does the husband and wife each get there own or do they only issue one? Reply Valera June 28, 20171) when I hyphenate my name can I keep my maiden name as is on my SS card and all other documents that require my SS number? Yes.2) If I change my name on my SS card as my hyphen name do I have to change it at the DMV, taxes and etc…? Some states have laws that say you must notify the DMV of a name change within X time frame, but they're typically toothless. You'll eventually have to update your name with the DMV when it comes time to renew. So, it's a now or later proposition. When you change your name with the SSA, the IRS is notified. Feel free to read more about IRS and name change.3) If I get married now, but wait a few years to change my name on my SS card as my hyphenate name, because I want to have a child and my family all have the same name can I do so? Yes, you can wait.4) When you get a marriage certificate does the husband and wife each get there own or do they only issue one? One, although you can order multiple copies. Reply Jane July 2, 2017When I was married 39 years ago in Mississippi, I dropped my first name given at birth so that my name became *middle,maiden,married*. This was done without any special hearing or court proceeding.. It was done simply by request when we applied for our license and is reflected on all legal and professional documents in this way. My husband has since died and I am remarrying in California in a just few months. We live in Alabama. I intended to keep all of my names with the exception of the first birth name that I dropped previously (I.e middle, maiden, 1st married, new married), but in reading the string, I am now concerned that the dropping of my first name might not have been legal. Could you please explain this further? If I find that it is legal, and I go forward with all four names, what are the designations of them? Which is considered first, middle and last? Am I asking for trouble while my reasons are just sentimental. I am not under pressure in my decisions. Thank you in advance!Reply Valera July 4, 2017I intended to keep all of my names with the exception of the first birth name that I dropped previously (I.e middle, maiden, 1st married, new married)Dropping your first name requires a court order. I am now concerned that the dropping of my first name might not have been legal. Could you please explain this further? Name change laws 39 years ago were not as well defined as they are today. If you were able to change it with all valid government agencies back then, then that's your legal name. You wouldn't be able to effect such a change so easily today though.

This is my second marriage and I kept my married name from my previous marriage for the sake of the kids. My kids are adults now, but my son was very sensitive about me changing my last name, and then my now husband was sensitive about me not taking on his last name (a bit old fashioned). So I thought I'd compromise and hyphenate my last name (and by the way, I don't have a middle name either), but now I'm on the fence about hyphenating my last name as I understand it could be a bit of a pain. The marriage license does have my last name hyphenated (i.e., Smith-Koors) and I know I need to go to SS, DMV, change the passport, etc. and make all the legal name changes at some point. My question is if on the marriage license my last name is hyphenated, do I need to continue hyphenating my name on everything else (SS, DMV, passport, legal docs, etc.)? Or can I not hyphenate it where I can keep my personal bank account and credit cards as is (i.e., B. Smith) and then use my married name as needed (i.e, B. Koors or full name B. Smith Koors when needed )? I'm trying to figure out if I need to hyphenate my last name or not, and if not, how I can use it. Thanks!Barb Reply Valera July 27, 2017My question is if on the marriage license my last name is hyphenated, do I need to continue hyphenating my name on everything else (SS, DMV, passport, legal docs, etc.)? Name change on the license is non-binding. You don't have to change your name on any document if you don't want to. Or can I not hyphenate it where I can keep my personal bank account and credit cards as is (i.e., B. Smith) and then use my married name as needed (i.e, B. Koors or full name B. Smith Koors when needed )? If you don't hyphenate, you'd have to use your prior last name in all formal situtations. I'm trying to figure out if I need to hyphenate my last name or not, and if not, how I can use it. If you don't a legal name name change, then you could only use your hyphenated name informally. When you do your taxes, fill out a government form, etc, you'll have to use your legal, non-hyphenated name. Reply Kayla August 2, 2017So, while this was a good read, I do have a question of sorts. My last name is my mothers maiden name. Even though she married my father after I was born, my last name was never changed. When they divorced, my father was awarded custody of me, and all through my school years I went as an Ericksen. Until I found out that my last name, legally, was Maloney when I was 18. I absolutely hate my mothers last name. She had no part of my growing up, and it's a memory I'd rather forget. I'm due to get married in December of 2019. I want to hyphenate my name, because I want to incorporate my fathers name, my heritage of Ericksen into my family. Can this be done? Or do I need to legally change my name to Ericksen before I can consider using it to hyphenate with. Everything from my school years (Diplomas', awards, etc) are in Ericksen but that was before I was an adult. Reply Valera August 3, 2017Hi Kayla. Yes, you would have to change it through court first.

You can return to the office where you obtained your marriage license and have them void your old license and reissue you another with your preferred name. You may have to repay the license fee, which in Minnesota is quite steep. It's one of the most expensive states in the nation for a marriage license. Reply Senait November 8, 2017Hi.

I read the article, and I know about the computer difficulty with hyphen. Thank you!Reply Valera December 15, 2017Hi Rachel. Space-separated last names are less prominent than hyphenated names because not all states easily allow a change of the prior—using a certified copy of a marriage certificate—the way they all do for the latter.

Reply Valera January 29, 2018How do I go about dropping my maiden name? How much would it coast? I live in Pa. You'd submit a name change petition in your county's Court of Common Pleas.

      "  \"contents\" : \"Advice for dudes changing their last names Photo by Wild About You Photography In the comments to this post about men changing their last names, I got this question: I don't want to change my last name, and my fiance is pretty open to changing his. But he's got 10 years of work under his belt with his name, and he'll be the first to admit – he works with a bunch of macho types who will probably not be so supportive. So he says, \\\"Show me another man that has done this – let me talk to him, let me learn how he navigated these challenges.\\\" … But I can't find him a single one, except anecdotally. So where are the men who have taken their wives' names? And how do I find them? !I know a couple men who've taken their wives' last names in two different ways (one got rid of his last name, the other hyphenated), so I pestered them for some answers: The dude: Will Merydith, CTO of software startup His maiden name: Will Anderson Macho cred: Former competitive snowboarder, watches COPS. Why did you decide to change your name? When we got married, we decided to keep our own last names. It wasn't until Dawn got pregnant that we decided a unified last name was important. We decided to take Dawn's last name for three reasons: Dawn's father died at an early age, when she was in college. His last name carried extra significance for her. My father has been estranged from his first family for over fifteen years. His name carried little importance to me. Hyphenated names are great symbols of unity and compromise, but silly. [related-post] What responses have you gotten? It's been weird. I think Dawn's friends see it as nothing surprising because they know her feminist past. My friends really never knew what to say. They responded with puzzled looks or statements indicating they would never do such a thing. Taking Dawn's last name ended up revealing that a lot of my male friends are more macho and conservative than I would have suspected. What advice would you give to men considering changing their names? Don't make the decision lightly. It's been a complete bureaucratic pain in the ass. Government agencies, my work, my insurance company, my credit card company, banks, the car loan agency, anything requiring a credit check … they are not accustomed to men changing their last names. It's been five years now and I still have a stack of photocopied documentation of my name change, ready to send in order to prove, yet again, that I am who I am. The dude: Rob Rummel-Hudson, Author His maiden name: Rob Hudson Macho cred: Known for cave-mannish confrontational outbursts, watches COPS. Why did you decide to change your name? When we were talking about getting married, Julie expressed hesitation to change her name, and I agreed that really, there was no reason for her to let go of the identity she'd had all her life just because of tradition, particularly one with perhaps some misogynistic origins. At the same time, we wanted to acknowledge our new family with our names, so it just sort of grew out of that, a desire to illustrate our new reality without either of us letting go of the identities that we'd grown up with. (Also, my student loan people lost me for about three years. Woo! Maybe I should change it to Hudson-Rummel and see if they lose me again. )What responses have you gotten? Responses have been mixed, largely depending on where we are. When we lived in Connecticut, it was less of a big deal than it has been in Texas, but even here, it seems to be less of a big deal than I thought it might be. Our families are both pretty conservative (surprisingly, since we're both such liberal heathens), and my family in particular isn't in love with it (my brother is like, \\\"I guess it's up to me to keep the family name going now\\\"), but honestly, I don't think either of us care much. What advice would you give to men considering changing their names? Balance out how you feel about the traditions that seem to suggest you should keep your name and leave the changing to her. Do you value those traditions? If they don't resonate with you, then really, they're not so much traditions as arbitrary rules without reason. Keep in mind that you're sending a message to the world, and while some people may react negatively to that message, I suspect that if you're considering it in the first place, you probably don't give much stock to those kinds of opinions. In the end, it's about how you identify yourself, in the context of your marriage and your new family. I'd love to hear from more men who changed their last names!

One groom's perspective on taking his wife's last name So far the name change hasn't cost me more than a few hours of paperwork, some explanations to public officials and a few strained conversations with brittle relatives who think…Read More Fix Typo Ariel Author of Offbeat Bride: Creative Alternatives for Independent Brides, Ariel acts as the publisher of all the Offbeat Empire websites.

I'm Puerto Rican, and the only woman I know who had to take her husband's last name is my grandmother; my grandpa was in the army and the US military pretty much forced her to do it. Of course, we're all used to having 2 last names to begin with, and for families to share the kid's last names: The \\\"Father's First Last Name\\\"-\\\"Mother's First Last Name\\\" Family. Is this really sucha big cultural/legal issue in the States? Will I have to change my name when I move back there?5 agree Reply Corinne 3:59 pm on Oct. 26It's not really a big deal for women, here in the states. You will absolutely not have to change your last name. The issues come for the men. It is not as culturally acceptable for men to change their name as it is for women. Men will just have to prove a lot more often that they are who they say they are when women do not.. This is just because men change their last name when they get married far less often when women do.5 agree Reply Mags 6:53 am on Apr. 15This is also a hot topic at my houseâ€¦ My future husband refuses to keep his last name. He said he either wants to take mine, or change his name to his motherâ€™s maiden name and I can take that. Under no circumstances does he want to carry on his fatherâ€™s name. (Insert years of pain and abuse here) In conversations we came up with a hybrid version of our names, since they are both Italian we can take the â€œDiâ€ prefix in his name and add it to mine. This way we each get a change. We have gotten such mixed feelings from friends and family, from â€œthatâ€™s dumbâ€, â€œwhat happened to tradition?â€ to â€œthatâ€™s awesome he wants your last name.â€ I think we are pretty settled on it, but given my parents are in their 70â€™s explaining this does not come without issues. Not to mention I started researching males changing their names and I canâ€™t believe the red tape you have to go through! Grrrrâ€¦ Thanks for sharing the above stories it is nice to have some reassurance that you are not crazy!5 agree Reply Jess L. 7:10 am on Apr. 15Thanks for your continued attention to this issue. My fiancÃ© is considering changing his name to mine, and luckily California is now an equal name change state, so it's easier than it could be!Our concern is that it seems like virtually every man who changes his name says something like, \\\"and I had a poor relationship with my father/family anyway.\\\" my fiancÃ© has a strong attachment to his family and is a little weirded out by this. From my perspective, I find it odd that no one expects women who change their name to have trouble with *their* family of origin! I wish we could talk to some men who changed for other reasons, like aesthetics or somesuch.25 agree Reply Greg Johnson 10:44 pm on Aug. 10Thanks for this comment! I am changing my name to my fiance's when we get married in September. Forst of all, it was my idea, not hers, and secondly, I have a pretty good relationship with my dad. Here are my reasons:1) Why should I need a reason? I've heard tradition cited, but \\\"TRADITION\\\" is the same BS argument that CA has been using to keep same-sex couples from marrying, so screw that. I have also heard that I would be insulting my family, but why wouldn't she be doing the same if she changed hers? For the record, I told my Dad far in advance, told him my reasons, and he is (at least I think) not insulted.2) She is an only child with no male cousins. If she drops her last name, it's gone forever (and it's a beautiful name too: Farren), I on the other hand, have 4 brothers, and our last name is Johnson. Is our name really in danger of going extinct? Please.3) I'm tired of having a generic name. When someone has to look up my account by name, I'm usually one of 40 billion \\\"Greg Johnsons\\\" in the system. Her last name is cool. I like it. The only thing that pulls on the strings of my masculinity at all is the phrase \\\"maiden name.\\\" But if enough people like me say \\\"screw it\\\" to tradition, maybe that word will become archaic.68 agree Reply Adica 11:17 am on Apr. 13Just start using the term \\\"birth name\\\" or something like that. \\\"Maiden name\\\" isn't even an accurate term for most women, anyway.33 agree Reply Jack 2:22 pm on Sep. 9You should ask your father again how he feels. My son just did the same yesterday on his wedding. I feel he did this due to the fact his mother and I divorced when he was young and never really accepted it. It ripped my heart out.3 agree Reply Jenz 4:30 pm on Oct. 6Do you mind if I ask why? Did he tell you that was his reason? Do you and he have a bad relationship otherwise? There are so many step-people and fostering/adoption in my family that I've never really considered a name a connection to my family. If your relationship is otherwise good, what is it about his changing his name that hurts you?2 agree Reply Brie 12:54 pm on Jun. 18My Fiancé has a very strong relationship with his family, but always wanted to change his name. He just didn't like the fact that he has a long last name that most people cant spell or pronounce. Where as I have a very easy very short last name.1 agrees Reply Jess L. 7:15 am on Apr. 15 (To clarify: not that these other dudes who changed names didn't have many other primary reasons! We just wish we could hear from guys who changed their names entirely for whom family history was not a huge factor. I just don't understand this fixation on Your Relationship With Your Father! )5 agree Reply Ariel 7:29 am on Apr. 15Jess, I think it's less of an \\\"I hate my dad!\\\" thing and more of a way to reason through the issue. If the name is passed down through patrilineal channels, it makes sense to consider your father when considering his name. I totally agree that it's a weird double standard that women don't typically think about these things, but I don't think it's odd that when men consider taking on a new name, part of what they think about is their relationship to their existing name … that they got from their father.15 agree Reply Shilo M 7:33 am on Apr. 15My fiance hates his last name and wants to change his to mine. At first I was into it, but as silly as it sounds, I was always looking forward to changing my name when I got married, and being a Mrs. So and so. Antiquated, sure fine whatever, but I wanted it However, I hate his last name too. It has the word \\\"cock\\\" in it. And not like totally ridiculous like Woodcock, just kinda lame. So, I'm not going to do that. Plus, after all the teasing and crap he says he had to put up with, if we have kids, I don't want to subject them to that. I thought about hyphenating, but I come from a french-canadian background where all the kids had hyphenated names, and then what happens when 2 kids with 4 names get together? Too complicated. He's going to change it, but I don't think he'll be able to stick to it because that means that he will hae to tell all his old buddies who call him by his last name that he's now \\\"so and so\\\" instead of \\\"blah di blah\\\" and since he's still sensitive to teasing, I just don't see it. Women in our society have been somewhat conditioned to accept the name change, but men are totally foreign to it. I don't think he understands that he's not just changing his name, he is erasing his old name. As in he will have to change his signature, all his documents, what he responds to. It's quite the paradigm shift. I suggested we wait until we had kids and changed it then so it's more like a family name, but he wants to change it after the wedding. My last name is actually my mother's maiden name because she was a single parent, so it's I guess sort of keeping with the tradition to continue to pass this name on matriliarily. which, I must admit is pretty cool since we are the bearers of life, so why shouldn't we pass our name on. But, it's not really my beliefs or those of my family and friends that worries me. It's this stupid soceity that feels it haas to judge and destroy anyone who does anything differently. I love my fiance so much, and I just don't want to see him teased by a bunch of sexists both male and female. I wish people would just mind their own damn business!19 agree Reply Nate Bear 12:00 am on Feb. 7Amen to the last two sentences. So far I'm mixed. I Like my last name a lot more than my fiancée's, but I wouldn't mind hyphenating it just to stick it to the man. Incidentally, I have my mother's maiden name, which wasn't even her birth name in the first place.6 agree Reply Nate B 12:01 am on Feb. 7Amen to the last two sentences. So far I'm mixed. I Like my last name a lot more than my fiancée's, but I wouldn't mind hyphenating it just to stick it to the man. Incidentally, I have my mother's maiden name, which wasn't even her birth name in the first place.2 agree Reply Shilo M 7:40 am on Apr. 15P.s Why do people feel it is their duty to tell you things like: If you don't do… (usually a big traditional wedding, or grade 12 math) that you'll \\\"regret it for the rest of your life\\\" and stuff like that? Who decided what and if I'll regret something. I'm a little \\\"offbeat\\\", and I've been hearing crap like this my whole life, and so far the only thing I regret is ever listning.48 agree Reply Aryanna 8:53 pm on Jun. 16HAHAHA!!!! Very true, but I just loved the way you said something I've thought for sooo long.4 agree Reply Blake 7:58 am on Apr. 15This is the first time I've seen first person male responses to this issue. It's a great post. My husband would definitely hyphenate if I asked him. He did for his last marriage. But I couldn't bring myself to change my name, so it was moot.7 agree Reply Will 8:05 am on Apr. 15Ariel your research has shown something extremely interesting – the relationship between watching COPs and taking your wife's name is clear. Jess – I've asked myself the question, \\\"would I have taken my wife's last name had I been close to my father?\\\" And that's an impossible question to answer obviously but I've tried. On one hand I'd like to think I'd have had the kind of relationship with my father to still make the decision to take my wife's name. On the other hand taking your wife's name is a rebellion the existing instituion of marriage and I would argue to your father (in this paternal system). I too would love to hear of someone who took their wife's name AND has a great relationship with their father. But not finding that individual shouldn't be of \\\"concern\\\" imo. Ultimately men taking their wife's name is an act of rebellion to the paternal component of marriage. Having a crappy relationship with your father makes that act of rebellion easier. But a man who takes his wife's name AND who has a good relationship with his father is most likely going to choose this path out of protest to the system or cultural circumstances. I could be wrong, but I think it's pretty early for the process of men taking their wive's names to be a choice that doesn't have any of this other baggage or offbeat cred around it. One last point of history on my situation: My wife and I weren't even going to get married – out of protest to the instituation of marriage itself. In part because our gay couple friends couldn't get married and reap the benefits of that contract. I worked at Disney at the time, which offered insurance to domestic partners. When I went to sign Dawn up, it turns out that Disney offers insurance to a) married couples and b) SAME SEX domestic partners. Disney's attitude is apparently that if you're living together you either needed to be gay or married.12 agree Replyknittykitty117 2:02 am on Jun. 19My partner has a relatively good relationship with his father, they're not super close but they can hang out OK and keep in touch. We're considering hyphenating our names because I'm not willing to let go of mine and I don't think his desire to change his second name has anything to do with not wanting to carry on the family name. Whereas if I change my name (I already did it once before, to my mother's maiden name) then it will die out. I'm the last X other than my grandparents and I don't want my family's name to disappear in that way.2 agree Reply Liz 8:36 am on Apr. 15My parents have friends who did this in the seventies. They hyphenated, one long name one short name. It works out well for them. I think it was mostly professional reasoning behind it- he needed a more \\\"authentic\\\" last name for the museum he curates.2 agree Replyteri 8:43 am on Apr. 15I asked a few of the more traditional guys I knew about this, just out of curiosity- wondering what level of harassment a guy changing his name should expect from these sorts of guys. The usual first reaction was \\\"wtf?? why??\\\". After I stoped ranting at them, the admited that away from femmenist female ears, they would probabaly give a guy friend of theirs a hard time about it. Then I asked \\\"what if he had a really shitty relationship with his dad and didnt want to carry on his name or have anything to do with him?\\\". That got a much more positive responce. Looks like, from my limited sample, guys with bad relationships with their father may not only have an easier time changing their names for sentimental reasons, but becuase their less likely to catch as much greif over it.8 agree Reply Kate 10:00 am on May. 5See, \\\"wtf?? why??\\\" is my first reaction to the idea that I (a woman) should change my name!7 agree Replymordicai knode 8:56 am on Apr. 15The dude: Mordicai Knode His maiden name: Burke Macho cred: Three titanium plates in skull from brass knuckle clobbering. Why did you decide to change your name? As some people have said, the (potential) little whippersnappers were the root of it. I wanted to have the same last name as them, & I attach more importance to my chosen family than my birth family. So as there wasn't a new name or a combination that worked, I went with hers. What responses have you gotten? Pretty much a \\\"good for you,\\\" & a \\\"uh, okay?\\\" mix. A few \\\"friendly\\\" uses of the word \\\"whipped,\\\" but I don't really sweat it. What advice would you give to men considering changing their names? I am still going through the legal hoops of it. A bit of a pain. Socially, I can only recommend it. New clan!17 agree Reply Sandy 9:32 am on Apr. 15Can we hear from couples who have both decided to drop their given last names and come up with a new married last name together?14 agree Reply Mary H 8:45 pm on Oct. 21I know this is way later than anyone else commenting, but I wanted to throw in my 2 cents. My fiance and I are both ditching our last names. Mine is \\\"Henderson\\\" and his is \\\"Berube.\\\" We've decided to change our last name to \\\"Berson\\\" as a fun combination of the two. Over the last few months, we've both really gotten in to building the strength of our new Berson family (even though we aren't married yet), and the new name has helped us feel a connection to the ways in which our lives are intertwined as we work together towards our mutual future.10 agree Reply Char Manders 10:55 am on Jun. 13My darling and I are also changing both of our names. At first he was a little hesitant, but when I explained that I didn't want to join his family but would rather create a new one, he understood. I also explained that women didn't start taking on their husbands names until the rise of christianity; In jewish culture men still take on the ladys name, as they did in old celtic cultures and egyptian.6 agree Reply Kate 10:02 am on May. 5I didn't know this about Jewish, Celtic, and Egyptian cultures, and it is wonderful!3 agree Reply Mattery 5:14 am on Jun. 21My partner and I will probably go for a portmanteau (combined name) too: Mattery. We're a 'Mattner' and a 'Buttery' at the moment and, while they're both awesome names, the portmanteau is the best way for us to symbolise the equality that we hold in so many parts of our relationship. One problem we weren't expecting was having to find a way to make the portmanteau work. Mattery doesn't fit brilliantly with his first name, but he's okay with the way it works. The other options were Battery, Muttery and Buttner, which are all hilariously awful.1 agrees Reply Esposalejana 8:43 pm on Oct. 24Close friends of mine both dropped their last names and between the two of them created a last name that reflected their love of ecology and their mutual interdependence on each other and their community. For their wedding favors they gave each guest a beautifully designed shirt with a definition of their new name on the back. I still have that shirt and those friends because although they live far away, they continue to nurture their relationships in a way that affirms their chosen name.5 agree Replykzilla 9:43 am on Sep. 3That's what we're doing…2 agree Reply Stephanie 10:43 am on Sep. 7Four years too late on this, sorry! But when we first got married, it was a shotgun wedding situation (long story), so I took his last name because I was so pissed at my family. I regret doing that because I really hate the tradition of it. We ended up both changing our last names to something we made up together: von Blackwood. Much more fancifully gothy that either of us had before! My hubby hasn't gotten any guff about changing it at all.4 agree Reply Sasha Sagan 3:14 pm on Oct. 6Hey, all. Kevin and I both changed our names to Sagan in honor of Carl Sagan. We both have strong relationships with both of our families, but we're not into the aesthetic of hyphens, and neither of us felt deeply attached to our 'maiden' names. Since we didn't do a legal marriage, the paperwork was a HUGE pain for both of us. It took a long time, and we 'gave' working on it to each other as presents for various anniversaries. We explained at the ceremony that we want our lives together to be defined by Carl's spirit of wonder and discovery. The decision definitely surprised some people, but we're not exactly normative in any way, so they dealt with it. PS, Kevin's macho cred: I asked, and he purports to be offended by the question5 agree Reply Hollie 10:09 am on Apr. 15On another note, I know a lot of women that have changed there married name but kept their professional name (especially those who have gone to Ph D and need that degree to have the same name) That way no credit card change. Can a guy not do that too?3 agree Reply Loaf 11:17 am on Apr. 15This is an interesting issue for gay couples too, who like the legal symbolism of having the same last name, even when the gov't won't recognize our relationships. But it presents a problem for us when we'd never consider changing our names if we were marryng men. And the whole kids thing is tricky too. It's nice to hear more perspectives on this!4 agree Replyabby 11:19 am on Apr. 15Both of us changed our last names to something completely different. We each have good, though completely different, relationships with our families; there was no reaction to a bad history for either of us. I wanted us to have the same last name as a representation that we were now a team–he & I, not me & the men in his family. He said, \\\"Well, you shouldn't have to be the only one who changes their name,\\\" which seemed fair. I filed all the paperwork and, 7 years later, we still get compliments on the name. The paperwork is a bit of a hassle, depending on where you live. If you are combining lives anyway, you are going to have to change some information no matter what. You might as well change a little more while you're at it. Of course I kept the copies of the legal documentation–every once in a while we still need to send a credit reporting agency one. I was raised very traditionally and yet my conservative family really didn't bat an eye when we did this. If you have always been a person who did things a little differently, wouldn't it be more shocking if you followed the norm suddenly because you were getting married? I would guess that negative or critical comments come from people who don't know the real you as well. No one in either of our families seemed to care, our friends didn't seem to think twice, and the only ones who gave me any hassle were the HR people who didn't know how to process the paperwork for him. Emotionally has it mattered to both have dropped our given names and chosen a new married name? It's hard distinguish from all of the other subtle changes that go along with marriage. My husband says, \\\"I hadn't really thought about it.\\\" So, there you go. He did suggest that it depends on how \\\"pliable\\\" your relationship is to your family and to your concept of legacy; his was pretty malleable. I also don't think he has a lot of macho friends he had to consider, though I suspect he would have done it despite them, if he had. As for the question that generated this comment, the length of work history with a certain name is a very legitimate argument, particularly if you're building a business of your own or an expertise in an industry. You've spent all this time on a brand and now you're going to change it because one of the unrelated features (your marital status) has changed? That's hard to argue for either the man or the woman. Deciding to change or not change your name because of the reactions of others is unsupportable as an argument and disrespectful to your spouse (you'd rather avoid comments from others about something that's none of their business than do what you and your spouse decide together). I guess if I were the guy, I would be cautious about the work thing and ask around to find out how it might have impacted others in his field. And I would drop the argument that \\\"my buddies will give me sh*t\\\" like a hot potato.11 agree Replybrava! 11:30 am on Apr. 15Such an interesting topic; I'm glad you posted about it!First of all, I don't know why anyone changes their name if they don't want to. And I can't imagine that the kind of guy who'd take his wife's surname would really care if other people snorted at it. He's gotta be secure and enlightened and that is sexxxxy!I always thought it would be easiest if girls got their mother's surnames and boys got their father's. It's not a perfect system, but at least it doesn't TOTALLY overrite the geneology of female lineage.9 agree Reply Jen 12:49 pm on Apr. 15My husband changed his name to mine-his. His family did not understand why, but for us, it was because my last name had major significance, I didn't want to lose it, and his name also had major significance so I offered the solution to both go hyphenated. We'd had numerous friends who had either changed their names to something completely different or hyphenated so it wasn't too strange for my husband to change his to \\\"mine-his\\\". It was our way of being equal on the name thing, why should the woman give up her perfectly good name? It's funny though, because my family sends us cards to Mr. and Mrs. Hyphenated-Last-Name and his sends them to Mr. and Mrs. \\\"His Last Name\\\", which should irk me, but actually irks him more.7 agree Reply MLE 1:27 pm on Apr. 15My husband and I decided before we were even engaged that, if we were to get married, we'd both change our last names to a new name. He's got a great relationship with his family but no particular ties to his last name (it's only been his family's name for 3 generations, long story) and I'm neither attached to mine nor do I have a particularly good relationship with my father. We wanted the same last name when we got married, but neither liked the other's name enough to change to that. Luckily, our old surnames combine quite nicely to make a new one that we both like a lot – Stryker. We've been telling people of our plans for the length of our engagement (14 months) and have to get the legal paperwork started, since we got married in CA and there was noplace for our names to be changed on the license, and we live in CO. So we're both going the court order name change route.4 agree Reply Heidi Aphrodite 3:05 pm on Apr. 15Great reading, but something to take into consideration are the genealogical implications. My parents are the genealogists for their respective sides of the family, and there has been confusion with last names in the past (second marriages, etc). If you choose to do this, make sure the records are very clear so that anyone doing research in the future doesn't want to get in a time machine and punch you for complicating stuff. That said, a guy I went to high school with took his wife's last name so her children wouldn't be confused or teased. I thought that was pretty awesome.6 agree Replyvillain 3:36 pm on Apr. 15My man and I are both changing our names. I had though, first of all, that I wasn't going to get married, so changing my name wasn't an issue. We both, as I'm sure most folks reading this, have issues with patriarchy and state-sponsorship of relationships. Finally, we decided that in order to make marriage into the sort of institutions we want to be a part of, we need to exemplify it. Put our money where our mouths are, so to speak. So,we decided to get hitched. I suggested that he take my name, but changing completely is really a better match for us. We're choosing a name that is not particularly outlandish and is what my maiden name means in another language. I'll keep my last name as another middle name. Not sure what he will do with his, but let me tell you there is no way in the nine hells that I would take his icky sounding name! It also helps to marry a feminist; I highly recommend it!7 agree Reply Cynthia 5:14 pm on Apr. 15This is an interesting topic. I kept my last name when I married (had to do lots of talking with the husband first…). My sister did the same thing. When they had their child the agreement was – if a daughter, her last name, if a son, his last name. Since she had a daughter, the family name has made it down yet another generation on the female side.6 agree Reply DQ 5:15 pm on Apr. 15\\\"and Iâ€™ve been hearing crap like this my whole life, and so far the only thing I regret is ever listning. Hear hear Shilo M!I have told the boy I will only change my name if he changes his, that seems very unlikely at this stage (I had suggested that i go hisname-myname, and he goes myname-hisname at one point). I would say we will end up keep what we already have and then work it all out if kids happen.2 agree Reply Peihan 5:33 am on Apr. 16We're also choosing a new last name (paperwork is already in process). For us, we got jammed in to a tight corner and a new name seemed to be the best way out. Here's our long story =P-FH was born with a hyphenated last name (mother+father's last names). He's encountered a lot of problems with paperwork, etc. with it, and wishes it was shorter.-FH's parents have since divorced (not amicably).-FH and I want to share a last name (along with any possible kids).-I don't want to take two last names, when neither of them are mine. I don't particularly want to keep mine, since I don't have a great relationship with my dad. So it would seem the easiest option would be to just choose one of FH's last names and keep that, which would be fine with me, but his parents were both very adamant that FH did not choose the other person's name over their own. Very, very adamant. And angry. Not good. So then we tried looking at past last names in the family tree. Same problem. Can't choose a name from the other person's side of the family either. So new name it is. Both of his parents would rather we took a new last name than the name of the other person. My parents sortof thought that I was going to change my name anyway, so they don't seem to care, though they think it's weird. I like this better anyway, since I never thought the whole woman-changes-her-name-but-guy-doesn't thing was very fair. We chose our name by using those baby name sites where you can search by meaning. So it has an important meaning to us, and some interesting classical relationships. And, google doesn't show it to be anything else obvious either =)5 agree Reply Ace 6:16 am on Apr. 16So nobody has yet discussed what happens when one party has been married already…I still have my ex-husband's last name (mostly because it's cool); my fiance has a name that is most definitely not cool. Naturally, he doesn't want to take my name, and I don't want his… Unfortunately, I think he's too conservative to consider making up a name. ~sigh~1 agrees Reply Alyssa 11:25 pm on Jun. 1Never settle8 agree Reply Leslie 8:44 am on Apr. 16I responded to the last post about this, but I thought I'd tell our story more fully this time around. When we were engaged, we both decided to change our last names to a new name when we got married. We were going to combine our maternal grandmothers' maiden names to make a new name, but my husband just wasn't that into it. Instead, we settled on changing to his mother's maiden name. My husband began the name changing process before our wedding, but his court date wasn't until after we got married. Because his old last name is on our marriage license, the Social Security office won't let me change my name to his new name (even if I bring in the court documents for proof). So we are in the process of trying to amend the marriage license (which is a bureaucratic pain in the ass) or just going through the courts to change mine. I think it's wonderful when men are willing to subvert tradition and take on a new name. I just wish that it had been easier for us.5 agree Reply VPG 2:24 pm on Apr. 16The mayor of Los Angeles, Antonio Villaraigosa, combined his last name with his wife's. He was Villar and she was Raigosa. They're getting divorced now, but I always like the idea.4 agree Reply Sara 4:54 pm on Apr. 16Great topic! I am having a hard time deciding what I want to do. When I was married for the first time, I kept my maiden last name as a middle, and took his really cool sounding last name, which is also a very unusual name. I kept the name after the divorce. Fiance's name isn't as cool, but it isn't bad either. And somewhat unusual. But I graduated college with this last name, and have built up a network with this last name. I was thinking about us keeping our own names, because I know he won't want my ex's name, and I don't particularly want to go back to my maiden name. I didn't think about the kids aspect, though, so I need to have a conversation with him about that. Thanks for a great string of comments!Reply Megan B 8:36 pm on Apr. 16I'm having trouble deciding too. I always thought I'd keep my name, but I never thought I'd fall in love with someone whose last name I like so much better than mine…Reply Sarah 11:55 pm on Apr. 16My fiance changed his name when he left school. He has a fabulous relationship with his father, but his surname had exposed him to enormous bullying at school as it is totally ridiculous. He wanted to lose it before he started university. He thought about it long and hard, and went with his mother's maiden name, which she still uses. I'm not terribly fond of my name, and I've always liked the idea of getting a new one when I got married. I quite like his, and I like the symbolism of having the same name. If he still had his original surname, I'm sure he'd change to mine – I certainly wouldn't be changing it to his!Reply Fourstar77 6:22 am on Apr. 17I had decided to take my wife's name before I ever met Jackie. Subordinating women is a time honored tradition, both through society and the Bible. I think this tradition has less to do with any mandate from God, and more to do with an ingrained sense of male superiority. Since I view men and women as equals, I felt I needed to do my part to tip the balance. Hyphenation is problematic for when you have children and they get married, so I just decided to take my wife's name. It is a great conversation starter on the misogynistic nature of our society. Usually women totally agree with me, and men don't want to look sexist in front of the women, so they nod their heads. I also tell people that there are no male Day's in my wife's family, but there are male Forsters. Therefore, I also took her name to keep the name going. I think it is a private decision that every couple should make together. I have no problem with a woman who takes their husband's name. But I think we should all consider the history of our society's treatment of women. That of second class citizens. I am happy to see that we have both a black and a female candidate this year. We are getting there, but we are still behind \\\"less developed\\\" countries like the Phillipines and Pakistan. That is really sad. As for changing your name, make sure to get a new driver's license first with your new name. They usually require the marriage certificate. Then you can go to the social security office to change the name on file w/ the federal government. The person at either office might give you a little trouble, but I think they are getting more used to this type of name change. I hope this helps. Matt8 agree Reply Josh 5:49 am on Apr. 1924 years old and about to be married. Going to take the woman's last name as my first-hyphen, and leave mine as a second-hyphen. We like the combined name, except that it sounds a lot like a certain famous hotel scion who made a sex tape. But maybe our marriage will outlast her antics? I haven't told my friends yet – I think I told my family? We have this conversation all the time, and girls are much better at remembering personal details than guys are (generally). We're both feminists, so in terms of philosophy it's all good. I probably would've gone either way, truth be told (hyphenation, combination or the girl taking my last name). It's one of those things wherein I like to defer to the person with stronger feelings. All the credit benefits and headaches seem to be an amusing touch, since I hadn't thought of that at all – and my credit is outrageous. Thanks for starting this conversation!1 agrees Reply Bracket 8:11 am on Apr. 20My fiance and I discussed this seriously for a long time before coming to any decision. We both love our own last names, and have established careers to which those names are attached. But we did want to feel like we were creating a new family, all our own, and wanted a unifying name to symbolize that. My middle name is already my mother's last name (she never changed it), so hyphenating wasn't high on my list of ways to deal with it, but ultimately seemed like the best way to not lose our own names, but join together in the formation of something new. So we're both hyphenating, My Last-His Last. So far, there has been a bit of eyebrow-raising about his decision to hyphenate along with me, but nothing overly negative. Most people have been incredibly supportive of our decision, which we're announcing on our invites. Reply Suzanne 8:47 am on Apr. 21I *think* I am going to go ahead and take his name, although I am still a little foggy on the logistics. So I'm not all that offbeat, but I did think I would offer my thoughts on the idea of \\\"brand recognition\\\" for those who have significant work product associated with their name. I have a girlfriend with a very long last name, who married a very nice guy with a very short last name. In order to not professionally disappear, she hyphenated (Her Last-His Last). For about three years, as I recall. Which was long enough for about everybody of interest (at locations across the country, as we both consult fairly widely) to become not only very familiar with the new component of her name, but also very tired of typing that whole hyphenated thing every time we needed a signature or referenced her recent work. Apparently people started suggesting strongly that she could just drop the hyphen and take the shorter name. As far as brand recognition, mission accomplished! She now has his last name. And a compendium of work under a total of three last names, but the hyphenated period does pretty effectively allow you to trace her work throughout her professional career.2 agree Replyatlantis 12:36 pm on Apr. 21I'm thinking of making my last name a second middle name and doing the same for our children if and when we have them, then we will all have my beloved name but also without the stress of the little ones having such a lengthy last name to combat. However the offer for him to change was laid on the table…but backwards his initals spell C. R. A. M and forward they spell his name…how can i mess with his little pleasures…2 agree Replyresa 4:47 am on Apr. 22I am keeping my last name, but doing the same for the kids as atlantis is. They will have my long, hard to pronounce, german last name as a middle name. This may be a good substitute for the asshole comments such as \\\"who will keep the family name going? \\\"1 agrees Reply Bernard Farrell 5:37 am on Apr. 23We got married 14 years ago. I wanted my wife to keep her name, which I really like. But she thought it was important to have mine. Maybe I should have changed mine. I don't remember if we talked about this approach. Sounds fine to me. Reply Redheadfae 2:48 pm on Apr. 26My former partner and myself wanted to both change our name to Wyrd. That way, when people talked about us, we would be \\\"that weird family down the street\\\". Unfortunately, we didn't last long enough to do the dirty deed, but what fun would it have been!3 agree Replylenor1 8:00 pm on Apr. 29My husband and I both changed our last name with a NEW one we created. When the question first came up on what name to use his or mine we decide neither I don't his father and my last name is misspelled all the time so we compromised. I LOVE his step dad and he was so supportive leading up to the weeding that we decided to surprise the family by using his with a twist. Since my maiden name begins with two L's and his step dads name is Lamb we added an extra L and got LLamb. The family loved the surprise.1 agrees Reply Amy 5:46 pm on May. 6Adding to what Bracket said, I just wanted to throw it out there that people get seriously lazy with what I've head called \\\"uselessly long\\\" names. Approximately a year ago I started going by my entire given name (I write or state my First Middle Last names each time) and it has been not quite a logistical nightmare since I haven't had to legally change anything, but a pain in the ass: some people use my whole name, some refuse to aknowledge my middle name, and me and any paperwork involved get alphabetized in two different places depending on whether my middle or last name was used. I wanted to share this because the problems I've run into seem similar to potential issues faced by people choosing to hyphenate their names, and personally, I hadn't anticipated any sort of problems when I decided to use my whole name.2 agree Reply Ariel 8:12 pm on May. 6Just to chime in on Amy's comment, y'all would not BELIEVE how many people think my name is Ariel Meadows. It's not: My first name is Ariel. My middle name is Meadow. My last name is Stallings. But people get lost somewhere between the second and third and just call me Ariel Meadows. I agree that hyphenation (unless each name was very short) would be equally as much a pain.1 agrees Reply Heather 4:16 am on May. 7Thought you might find this story on Salon interesting — it's about a couple in CA that went through \\\"two years, a lawsuit alleging sexual discrimination, and a change in California law\\\" for the man to change his name: The groom will be changing his name.2 agree Reply Karen 4:40 am on May. 18I have a few friends who went through this. My friend Paul changed his last name when he married his wife, beacuse she already had a daughter and wasn't willing to change her last name or her daughter's. He decided he was more than comfortable with changing his name to hers to show that he was a part of their family. When my other friends got married, the groom already had a hyphenated last name and the bride wasn't keen on having a hyphenated name when one of them wasn't her name. So they decided to take only the groom's father's name, and both of them changed theirs. And one example that has nothing to do with getting married – a couple of my sister's friends in high school had horrifically long hyphenated last names. Their mother's name was 10 letters long and their father's was 9 letters. So the kids combined the two names together to make one that was a little easier to handle. I don't know if it was an official change, or if they were just known by that name in school.1 agrees Reply Heptadecagram 11:04 am on May. 18I changed my name to my wife's. Part of it was for name-unity, we were planning on having kids, and didn't want to have to deal with different or hyphenated names. Both of us feel it's important to subvert the Heterofascist Raciopatriarchy (tm). That's part of the reason. Another part is that I've been disowned from my family (for such subversions), so there's really no need for me to keep my former name. I'm willing to be a force for social change, but that's just me. If you are male and change your name, places will give you a hard time about it! All states in the US will allow a woman to change her last name with solely a certified copy of the marriage license, whether it be a new driver's license, SS card, or whatever. When I first went to the SSA to get a new card, they told me that I couldn't get one without a court order, and pointed to a place in their regulations that said that a marriage license could be used only if the agent allowed it. This agent didn't, so that didn't work. I finally managed to get a new driver's license in my state's DMV using just the license, and then used that to get a new SS card, credit cards, and the like. Last note, I don't think it's fair to say \\\"if he's not willing to change his name to yours, why should you be willing to change yours to his?\\\" Such a question doesn't really work in a vacuum, outside of societal pressures. It's similar to saying \\\"I'm willing to go topless at the beach, why aren't you? \\\"3 agree Reply Eli 11:48 pm on May. 26Neither of us have middle names. I love (like, deeply love) my (very unique) last name, and don't so much like his (very plain). We've agreed to take each other's last name as a middle name. No hyphen. A new initial in each of our names. My future stepson has his mother's maiden name, and she's since been married. If/when he comes to live with us, I've agreed that I'll change mine for the sake of family unity, but only if he wants us to all have the same last name. Reply Erin 2:00 am on May. 28My partner and I have been together for 5 years, and at my family reunion earlier this year, I told him I'd like to keep my name when we get hitched…or even get him to change to mine (his first and my last sound better than me with his last name). Didn't go down as well as I'd hoped.. Reply Cass 9:28 pm on Jun. 4My fiance said he would be willing to enter into discussion about me keeping my last name, but I don't think he's offbeat enough to ever think of taking mine. Unfortunately, I'm last in the *Italian-name-here* line, which makes me totally sad that I can't \\\"pass it on\\\", and also totally bummed to lose my sweet last name which totally jives with my first name. That said, I consider myself quite offbeat, but also a little lazy and not willing to fight real hard for something that isn't really THAT big of a deal to me. So the Italian with the sweet opera-star-sounding name goes plain old Irish…and another one bites the dust.2 agree Reply Jesse 12:00 pm on Jun. 8I have grown up in a feminist household, yet I feel that honoring tradition doesn't have to equate with opression of women. I am about to be married, and I would never take my soon to be wife's last name. For clarity, I work in a female dominated field, and I probably wouldn't receive any negativity if I did take her name. That being said, the guys on here saying that most of their friends didn't hassel them are delusional. I know almost all of my friends, liberal or conservative would hound me about how \\\"whipped\\\" I am. I guess I feel it is okay to be a man and hold onto tradition…it's just a name, I am not putting her into servitude.1 agrees Reply Stefanie 11:06 pm on Jun. 30I didn't even consider changing my last name when I got married. My husband said he would consider changing his, but I thought why should either of us have to change our names. I'm the only person left with my father's rather unique last name and my husband can trace his family name really far back. It seemed important for both of us to keep our names. The funny thing is we don't know if we even want kids. I guess the point of carrying on the name is moot if we don't have kids. Replyingo 4:39 pm on Jul. 2my husband and i both changed our last names dramatically. he used to be andy smull, i was ingo wurl, now we're pixels! we told people about it all along the way, as we were working on choosing a name and when the wedding was rolling around. we even invited our friends to help us choose (though we took suggestions with a grain of salt as this was a very important decisions) we had some hilarious party discussions over cocktails about possible silly names. when it was all said and done no one was surprised and it just worked perfectly!3 agree Reply Read more comments1 2 ›Join the conversation Your email address will not be published.

      "  \"contents\" : \"Differential backup From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedianavigation search A differential backup is a type of data backup that preserves data, saving only the difference in the data since the last full backup. The rationale in this is that, since changes to data are generally few compared to the entire amount of data in the data repository, the amount of time required to complete the backup will be smaller than if a full backup was performed every time that the organization or data owner wishes to back up changes since the last full backup. Another advantage, at least as compared to the incremental backup method of data backup, is that at data restoration time, at most two backup media are ever needed to restore all the data. This simplifies data restores as well as increases the likelihood of shortening data restoration time. Contents [ hide ]1 Meaning2 Usage consistency3 Illustration4 See also5 References6 Further reading Meaning [ edit]A differential backup is a cumulative backup of all changes made since the last full backup, i.e., the differences since the last full backup. The advantage to this is the quicker recovery time, requiring only a full backup and the last differential backup to restore the entire data repository. The disadvantage is that for each day elapsed since the last full backup, more data needs to be backed up, especially if a significant proportion of the data has changed, thus increasing backup time as compared to the incremental backup method. Usage consistency [ edit]It is important to use the terms \\\"differential backup\\\" and \\\"incremental backup\\\" correctly. The two terms are widely used in the industry, and their use is universally standard. [1] A differential backup refers to a backup made to include the differences since the last full backup, while an incremental backup contains only the changes since the last incremental backup. (Or, of course, since the last full backup if the incremental backup in questions is the first incremental backup immediately after the last full backup.) All the major data backup vendors have standardized on these definitions, including Microsoft, Acronis, and Symantec. Microsoft, makers of Backup and Restore, defines incremental backups and differential backups as follows: [2] \\\"Incremental: An incremental backup provides a backup of files that have changed or are new since the last incremental backup.... Differential: A differential backup provides a backup of files that have changed since a full backup was performed. A differential backup typically saves only the files that are different or new since the last full backup, but this can vary in different backup programs. Together, a full backup and a differential backup include all the files on your computer, changed and unchanged.\\\" Microsoft products, such as Exchange Server 2010 use this definition in their literature and support sites. [3]Acronis, makers of Acronis True Image, states that “A differential backup backs up only the files that changed since the last full back... Incremental backups also back up only the changed data, but they only back up the data that has changed since the last backup — be it a full or incremental backup.” [4]My SQL, makers of My SQL Enterprise Backup, states that \\\"An incremental backup only backs up data that changed since the previous backup [full or incremental].\\\" [5]CA Technologies, makers of Arc Serve, states that “Incremental Backup…backs up the… files that have changed since the last backup. Differential Backup… backs up …files that have changed since the last full backup.” [6]Symantec, makers of Backup Exec, states that “An Incremental backup backs up only the selected files that have their archive bit set to ON, setting them back to OFF. This results in a backup of all files that are new or changed since the last backup, whether it was a full or an incremental... A Differential backup will back up all selected files that are new and changed since the last full backup.” [7]EMC Corporation, makers of EMC Net Worker (formerly Legato), states that “Incremental is a backup of latest changes since the last backup (any level) so when a full recovery is needed you would need to restore the last full backup plus all the incremental [backup]s until the point-in-time you want to restore... Differential backups are incremental backups since the last full backup… the differential backups will always save the differences between the last full.” [1]Quest Software, makers of Net Vault Backup, states that “Incremental – An Incremental backup transfers the changes in a volume since the last Full, Differential, or Incremental backup. Incremental backups consume minimum storage space and are quicker to perform... Differential – A Differential backup transfers the changes in a volume since the last Full backup. Differential backups speed up recovery since the plug-in is only required to restore two savesets, the Full and the latest Differential backup.” [8]Illustration [ edit]The difference between incremental and differential backups can be illustrated as follows: [1]Incremental backups: Day Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Backup Type Full Incremental Incremental Incremental Incremental Incremental Incremental Full Effect N/A Changes since Sunday Changes since Monday Changes since Tuesday Changes since Wednesday Changes since Thursday Changes since Friday N/AThe above assumes that backups are done daily. Otherwise, the “Changes since” entry must be modified to refer to the last backup (whether such last backup was full or incremental). It also assumes a weekly rotation. Differential backups: Day Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Backup Type Full Differential Differential Differential Differential Differential Differential Full Effect N/A Changes since Sunday Changes since Sunday Changes since Sunday Changes since Sunday Changes since Sunday Changes since Sunday N/AIt is important to remember the industry standard meaning of these two terms because, while the terms above are in very wide use, some writers have been known to reverse their meaning. One case, for example, is the one found at The Elder Geek website. [9]Oracle Software also leverages a backward description of differential backups in their DB product as of May 14, 2015: [1]Quote \\\" Differential Incremental Backups In a differential level 1 backup, RMAN backs up all blocks that have changed since the most recent cumulative or differental incremental backup, whether at level 1 or level 0. RMAN determines which level 1 backup occurred most recently and backs up all blocks modified after that backup. If no level 1 is available, RMAN copies all blocks changed since the level 0 backup. \\\"See also [ edit]Backup rotation scheme Continuous data protection Delta encoding Disk Archive - portable robust program for archiving and backup Dump (program) - UNIX utility for multilevel incremental file system backups.rsync - File synchronization algorithm and protocol.

Nancy Dru (formerly Nancy W. until I got married to Drupal)Nancy Dru Log in or register to post comments Use node.tpl.php and template.phpmoreorless commented 8 years ago This is the way I solved this. It may seem quite obvious to old-hands but it took me a while to work it out so I thought I'd share. I first tried:print strftime ( \\\"%m-%d-%Y\\\", $node - > changed)It worked okay except my host's server time is set to GMT which, over here in Australia, threw the dates out. I needed a better solution. Here's how I did it - step-by-step.1. In Site building > Themes > Configure look at the 'Display post information on' box on the right and check the content types you want date updated applied to.2. Make sure you have a copy of node.tpl.php in your theme directory. You can edit this file to place the print $submitted declaration wherever you want on the page. I wanted it at the bottom of the page, below the content, so placed the declaration at the bottom of the file.3. Make sure you have a copy of template.php in your theme directory. Add the code provided at http://drupal.org/node/511642 to the file. If the phptemplate_node_submitted function is already declared in the file you will either have to delete or comment this existing declaration out.4. Edit the code provided at http://drupal.org/node/511642 to customise the date modified output. I wanted a stripped-down output so used this:function phptemplate_node_submitted ( $node) {$time_unit = 86400; // number of seconds in 1 day => 24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds$threshold = 1;if ( $node - > changed && ( round ( ( $node - > changed - $node - > created) / $time_unit)> $threshold)) { // difference between created and changed times > than thresholdreturn t ( '@changed', array ('@changed' = > format_date ( $node - > changed, 'custom', 'l, d F Y'),// '!username' => theme ('username', $node),// '@created' => format_date ($node->created, 'small'),));}else {return t ( '@datetime', array (// '!username' => theme ('username', $node),'@datetime' = > format_date ( $node - > created, 'custom', 'l, d F Y'),));}}That's it. Works well and the dates reflect local time as defined in the Drupal set-up.

Personally, I would add it in hook_node_view () where it can be part of the node's output. Even better would be to also add hook_extra_fields () so that the admin can place it according to their preferences. Nancy Dru Log in or register to post comments The more correct place to put/better way-outmadhukarkr commented 3 years ago Thank you @Nancy Dru for pointing this out.

Nancy Dru Log in or register to post comments Site Update Date Requirementdotmundo commented 2 years ago Hey Nancy,I came into this thread very late and may not have read all the details but I ran into this problem recently and the issue I had with the requirements, as well as yours, is what are you defining as the \\\"site\\\"? Is it just the content, which are typicaly nodes, or everything that appears on the site including, logo, icons, image, buttoms, menus, headers, footers, etc. At the same time, what kind of changes you wish to convey to their audience as to what changed? For example, if there is a typo in a particular article, what value does that have to the user to know this has been update? Highly irrelevent if you ask me. However, if there is a change to what I call as the Product Content, that is the site's main content, then yes there is value to that. For example, if an insurance company modifies their health plans, the public needs to know how current that info is. With that said, you may want to use take the following My SQL script into a function: SELECT MAX (n.changed) FROM node n WHERE status = 1 AND n.type IN (article, page, etc. )For entities, this module might be of use, https://www.drupal.org/project/entity_modified and if it is, you can enhance the SQL above to use a UNION. Note that if you have pertinent content in blocks, this will not work since the block schema does not store dates. You will need to use the Node Block module for that. I hope I understood your need. Raul Log in or register to post comments Thanks, Raul Nancy Dru commented 2 years ago It is not my need. Like you, I understand the low value of such an indicator.

      "  \"contents\" : \"Providing free legal information and representation to the low income community since 1969. YOUR LEGAL NAMEYour legal name is the name that was put on your birth certificate when you were born or, if you were born outside Canada, it is the name on your admission papers. Your legal name is your first and last names, and your middle names if you have any. There are legal rules about how names are to be chosen and how to change names. Know the rules before you change your own name, name your children, or change your children’s names. CHANGING YOUR OWN NAMEHow Do You Change Your Name? If you want to change your name, you do not necessarily have to change it legally. You can just decide what you would like your name to be and then tell people like your family, friends, employer and co-workers that you would like them to call you by the new name. This is called changing your name by common usage. Once people have begun to call you by that name, you can have your identification changed to your new name; you might need to make an oath stating that people now call you by your new name for some identification changes. Also, you can change your signature to your new name and put your new name on legal documents. Remember that you can not change your name if you are trying to get out of having to pay money back that you owe, or for any other fraudulent reason. You can make an application to change your name under the Vital Statistics Act if you want to legally change your name. Making a legal name change is the only way to get a new birth certificate with your new name on it. To change your name legally, you must be a resident of Alberta and you must either be over the age of 18 or, if you are under the age of 18, you are married, in an adult interdependent relationship, or the parent/guardian of a child. You can get an application form to legally change your name by going to any Alberta Registries office. For the location nearest you, check the Internet for License and Registry Services. You will have to fill out an application and return it to a registry office with the required fees. Fees are collected by your local law enforcement agency to obtain your fingerprints. Fees are also collected by the registry agent for the provincial government name change fee, fingerprint registry fee, and a registry agent service fee. Check with your local law enforcement agency and local registry office for current fee amounts. You can also change your name by completing a deed poll, which is a formal declaration stating that you now want to be called by a new name. Changing your name with a deed poll is not a legal name change but it is more formal than just changing your name with common usage and it may be easier to get new identification issued under your new name if you have prepared a deed poll. Fingerprint Requirements The Vital Statistics Act requires every Albertan over the age of 12 to submit their fingerprints when they apply for a legal name change. Fingerprints can be obtained from your local law enforcement agency and must be presented to the registry agent with your application. Children under the age of 12 do not need to provide their fingerprints when you apply to have their names changed. You will also require identification to begin the process. GETTING MARRIEDIn Alberta, a person does not have to change their last name to their spouse's last name when they get married. Most people who change their names when they get married do not legally change their names; instead the name change is done through common usage. Note that another province may require a legal name change to recognize a married name. Both men and women have many options on what to do with their names when they get married:1. A person can decide not to make any changes to his or her name.2. Either the husband or the wife can choose to change his or her surname to the other person’s surname.3. Either the husband or the wife, or both, can decide to combine their two last names and/or hyphenate them. For example, Janell Cook and Moose Moonbeam could become Janell and Moose Cook-Moonbeam.4. Married people can also decide to use the last name that they had at birth for legal purposes and a different last name for social purposes. For example, after Janell Cook marries Moose Moonbeam she can keep using Cook as her legal name but her friends might call her Mrs. Moonbeam. Changing Your Name Back After You Get Married Married, separated or divorced people who changed their names through common usage when they got married, can go back to their original name at any time. This type of name change is again done through common usage; you cannot apply to legally change your name back because you never legally changed it in the first place. Changing Your Name in a Common Law/Adult Interdependent Relationship If you want to, you can change your name to the name of your adult interdependent partner or you can hyphenate your partner’s name with your own. You can make a name change like this simply through common usage. The Adult Interdependent Relationships Act defines adult interdependent partners as:1. Adults who have lived together in a relationship of interdependence for at least 3 years,2. Adults who have lived in a relationship of interdependence of some permanence if there is a child of the relationship,3. Or adults who have entered into an adult interdependent partner agreement with each other. Adult Interdependent Relationships can include same-sex relationships. INHERITANCE RIGHTSChanging your name does not in any way affect your inheritance rights. Having someone’s last name does not give you more rights than anyone else, because other methods are used to determine entitlement to someone’s estate. NAMING YOUR CHILDUnmarried Parents When an unmarried woman has a baby, the baby is given the mother’s last name unless:· The father is willing to sign a paper saying that he is the father and both parents agree that the baby should have the father’s last name. You can get the paper, called a “paternity declaration” from any registry service and hospitals. OR· Both parents request that the baby have both of their last names. For example, if the baby’s father is John Smith and the mother is Jane Doe, the baby could be Biff Smith-Doe or Biff Doe-Smith. These rules apply even if the parents live in a common law relationship because they are legally unmarried. Married Parents Married people can choose to register their children under the father’s last name, the mother’s last name or a combination of the two. Both parents must agree on the last name for their children, even if the parents are separated. If the parents cannot agree, the child will be given a hyphenated name with the two names listed in alphabetical order, or, if the parents have the same name, the child will be given that name. A child cannot have more than two names hyphenated together. If the husband in a marriage is not the biological father of the child, he will still be presumed to be the father unless:· The mother swears an affidavit saying that she was separated from her husband when she became pregnant and that the husband is not the father;OR· The biological father swears an affidavit that he is the father and both he and the mother ask that the child be given the father’s last name, or a hyphenated name that includes the father’s last name. Possible Names for Your Child A child’s name can only be changed to:· The mother or father’s name before they were married;· The mother or father’s name after they were married; or· A hyphenated version of the parents' names A child can not be given any other name, even if both parents agree to it. Children can request to change their names to anything that they want once they are 18. Changing a Child’s Name A change of name of a child requires the consent of both parents, the consent of the child if the child is over 12, and the consent of any other court appointed guardian. If one of the parties refuses to consent, the requesting party can make an application in court to change the child’s name anyway but they will have to prove that it is in the best interests of the child to change the child’s name. It is also possible for a parent with custody to informally change the child’s name through common usage without it being a legal name change. For example, the parent might ask the child’s school to use the parent’s last name rather than the child’s legal last name. If the other parent objects to that name being used for the child, that parent can apply to court for an order prohibiting the child to be called anything but the child’s legal name. In deciding whether to make the order, the court may consider such things as embarrassment to the child, the effect of a name change and the child’s relationship with the non-custodial parent. Children who have had their names changed this way can get identification in the new name but they will need a statutory declaration (which is a formal statement under oath) saying that the new name is the name that the child is known by in the community. Once children are 18 years old, they can legally change their names to almost anything without needing consent of their parents. There are regulations as to what a person can change their name to. Changing a Child's name After the Death of One Parent A parent can change the name of his or her child if the other parent has died and, if there are any, the remaining guardians have consented. Such a name change can be done informally through common usage or legally under the Vital Statistics Act. Children and Common-Law Relationships Parents can apply to legally change their children's names or they can informally change their children's names through common usage. If the parent wishes to change the child’s surname to the surname of the parent’s new spouse or common-law spouse/adult interdependent partner who is also a parent of the child, the parent would need that person's consent, and the consent of the other biological parent. If the parent wanted to change the child's surname to the surname of the child's biological father, the parent may do so if the alleged father has been declared by the court to be the father or has acknowledged paternity. If the child is 12 years old or older, the child must consent to having his or her surname changed. Adoption When a child is adopted by two parents, the child gets a new birth certificate reflecting the names of their new legal parents. The child must consent if he/she is 12 years old or older. PUBLICATION OF NAME CHANGESName changes are published in the Alberta Gazette by the Director of Vital Statistics. The Court of Queen’s Bench can dispense with the need for publication if it will unduly prejudice, harm, or embarrass the person. The Director may also dispense with the need for publication if the change is minor, or if the person is commonly known under the name applied for. \"\n",

      "  \"contents\" : \"Top 5 reasons hyphenated names are awesome Which name do I choooooose? Thanks to flickr member erinbellavia27 for submitting this to the pool. Last name discussions seem to happen a lot when weddings come up — especially on Offbeat Bride. Do you change your name at all? If so, do you just take your partner's last name or do you hyphenate? Does your partner change his or her name? Do you combine names or make up a totally new one? As someone who has had a hyphenated last name — Rebecca Jean Miller-Webster — my whole life, I feel uniquely qualified to deal with the last name issue. I mean, I have been asked since I was about six years old what I would name my kids. Seriously. My answer: \\\"I don't know if I'm having kids.\\\" I was six. My reasoning: why would I have kids if I can't have my name too? Since I've been asked since I was a kid what I would name my kids, I want to address it quickly … but I'll get to the top 5 list soon, I swear! My feeling about the \\\"But what will you name your kids?\\\" question is this: Everyone has to deal with this question. Everyone makes a decision about what last name to give their kids (or take as a spouse). They either make that decision without much thought and go with cultural convention, or they may make a thoughtful, conscious decision (which still could mean going with cultural convention). It is not a question that is unique to those with hyphenated names. This is just hilarious. Thanks to flickr member zachlinandcate for posting this to the pool. Perhaps it's my own sensitivity, but I've found a general trend on this and other alt-bridal sites against hyphenated names. There seems to be this idea that it's really horrible or something. Well, I'm here to tell you that I LOVE my last name. Like love love. I might marry it if I could. (I jest!)Ok. Quick disclaimer (and then I PROMISE to get to the point! ): I know there are people out there with hyphenated last names who probably hate them and I am in no way telling you what to do about your own last name — that is a totally personal decision. And for the record: I did not change my name when I got married. What will I do with the kids? I'm still not sure we'll have any. We do joke that we'll give them a triple hyphenated name. I'm also not saying that having a hyphenated name is all bunnies and daisies. It can be annoying. For example, airlines don't let you use hyphens in your name on a plane ticket. Pharmacy clerks seem to have a really really hard time with the idea that the first letter of my last name (Miller-Webster) is M and not W. I tend to think that this isn't any worse than someone with a space or strange character in their name, or just a name that is difficult to spell. Phew. Disclaimer done.

You know how people like to call others by their full name: First Name Middle Name Last Name? You got that three name ring without anyone having to know your middle name. In other words, it's fun to say. (This is based on the totally unscientific study of how often I hear my full name said.) Rebecca Miller-Webster FTW!3. Everyone always remembers your name. ALWAYS.2. I definitely don't have a Google doppleganger. What's a Google doppleganger? It's the person (sometimes the sketchy, criminal, drunken person) who comes up ahead of you when you (or a prospective employer) google your own name. BUT if I was Rebecca Miller or Rebecca Webster, there would be about a billion other people with my name.1. The most awesome thing about my hyphenated last name? It's mine. Whether it's an homage to your parents, an honor to your new family, or completely your own, your last name is a part of who you are and that pretty much makes it awesome squared.

The birth certificate is a new one to me.4 agree Reply T. Smith 6:06 pm on Aug. 18It's not true for simply getting married. Your name remains the same on your birth certificate. You only get a new birth certificate if you are legally adopted and change your name for that reason. And, even then, not always, I'm thinking. Reply Schuyler 7:06 am on Jul. 16No, if you legally change your name it is still not changed on your birth certificate. I legally changed my name and was told in instances where a birth cert is required for ID I would also have to show the court document that legally changed my name.5 agree Reply Asenath 7:09 pm on Apr. 3I believe this varies by state as some make after-the-instant changes to birth certificates and some expressly forbid changes to birth certificates. I believe the same is true with assigned-at-birth gender and parents, some states allow changes and others do not.3 agree Reply Sarah O'S 12:24 pm on Mar. 7I feel your pain. Try having an apostrophe in the name O'Sullivan. People think my middle name begins with O, my surname is Sullivan. Nobody seems to get that both letters should be capitalised. Worst of all, an apostrophe in javascript or something pertaining to online forms means the extremely long tedious form you just filled in errors because of your name. I've even had banks saying my name was invalid. But after the fight to take my step dads name, I wouldn't get rid of it for the world. I'm going to make life harder for myself by making it a second middle name and then taking his double barreled, unusual spelling name. Oh the fun that lies ahead2 agree Reply Ken O'M-L 2:10 pm on Aug. 18Try being apostrophe'd and hyphenated.4 agree Replyshorty j 12:31 pm on Mar. 7If I change my name at all, I'm hyphenating purely because then my last initials will be \\\"BS,\\\" because I am emotionally a fourteen-year-old boy. But I told my partner that I'm not hyphenating unless he does, which he hates because then *his* initials will be BABS. Bwahaha. No, but seriously. I *love* my last name. A LOT. I am either hyphenating or doing nothing at all because I refuse to give up my awesome name. My only concern is that my current last name is short (5 letters) and my partner's last name is, like, four thousand letters and very few vowels, so people always mangle it. We went on a cruise recently, and went through hell trying to get our documents together–they couldn't find us in their databases after we'd booked the tickets, and it turned out it was because one of the data entry folks had mangled the spelling of his last name beyond recognition. Hmm, decisions, decisions11 agree Reply Rachel H. Scotland 5:28 am on Mar. 23shit, my initials will be BS too! All my initials will be RBS… Like the failed bank!2 agree Reply Bonnie 1:09 pm on Apr. 2I was born with the initals BS, and I can tell you it's been fun my entire adult life. I like to call people their initials if they are cool like MC or something like that and then have them call me by mine and then they get all giggly when they realize what they've just said.

For the entirety of middle school, I went by Leo B-S. My entire squad and I would torture teachers with it so often, they would just call me Leo BS without a fight. I am changing my name once I turn 18, but not just to get rid of the BS, as I have reasons that I don't want the S associated with me. So in the future I will be Leo B with no middle name. It was fun while it lasted, and who knows, maybe I will just change the S to something else like J or something. x DReply Bethany 12:59 pm on May. 9I can do one better…my initials will be BSBS…as I told my mom- Double the BSReply Laura 12:32 pm on Mar. 7My last name is French, it has letters that are not pronounced, and it sounds horrible if said without a French accent. That being said I do love it. It is my name after all. However, when I wed my FH I will be taking his MUCH easier to say and spell last name. I will be keeping my maiden name, and use it along with my middle name without a hyphen. The bonus is I get two middle names which I have always wanted.10 agree Replytashamonster 3:33 pm on Mar. 7i did the same thing. my husband's last name was SUPER easy, while my maiden name was complicated and hard to spell. so now my middle name is my maiden name!2 agree Reply Cortney 5:30 am on Mar. 9I plan to do the same, when my time comes. I already have two middle names, why not tack on a third? *;)4 agree Reply Cynthia 1:23 am on Apr. 4I never thought of doing things that way before! I have the same problem…my current last name is Italian and long and hard to spell and pronounce. My FH's is only shorter by 2 letters, but is much easier to pronounce and spell. I have always been proud of my Italian heritage and name, but it's killer when spelling it out for someone over the phone, or listening to someone butcher it. I have considered the hyphenating thing, but then my last name alone would be ridiculously long and my name doesn't fit on most lines as it is. However, it would be interesting to keep my maiden name as a middle name. Thanks for the idea! Now the only question is, do I keep my original middle name or nix it? I kind of like the idea of having 4 names though.2 agree Reply Asenath 10:06 am on Apr. 4I did exactly that, 4 names. I have always liked my name just the way it is and I wanted to keep the history attachment I have to my last name but it was super important to the husband that I have his name also. Dropping my middle name was a no go from the beginning, it is unique and familial and will be passed on to the generation I create. So when it was time to change my name it became Myfirst Mymiddle Mylast Hislast. A four part name. At the SS office they told my I could have my name read out however I wanted (the exact example I believe was Purple Mc Stuffins Twinkletoes) so both my last name and his last name are my legal last name separated by a space because I don't prefer hyphens and now I can use either last name. In short: I vote for having 4 names!6 agree Reply Sarah aka pearlsandcupcakes 12:37 pm on Mar. 7My fiancÃ© and I have decided we're both taking our names together, probably hyphenated. My name is so common it's ridiculous, which brings it's own set of challenges, such as the wonderful confusion throughout college regarding me vs. the other Sarah M***** who also had blue eyes, blonde curly hair, and a very similar major to mine.

I also love my maiden name, Walton (and for the record, my brother is John Boy!). I also loved the tradition of taking my husbands name so I just compromised.2 agree Reply Neurocity 10:27 pm on Mar. 17My friend has that policy- and triplets. The two boys have the father's last name and her daughter has her last name. My feminist mother had quite a mouthful to say when she heard about it- that separating by gender is no better than having all children take one last name- but I think it will give the littler girl (who is still a baby) a special bond with her mother growing up.3 agree Reply Julie 10:00 am on Jan. 27My fiance and I are considering doing two last names with no hyphen. I am wondering if sometimes people ignore your first last name, thinking it's your middle name? Or any other issues you might have. Or, if you really like it, I'd love to hear about that as well.1 agrees Reply Inaya 4:31 pm on Apr. 3My FH was born with two unhyphenated last names. It's been horrible for him. All of his major forms of ID (birth certificate, SS card, passport) have different versions. All 1 word, hyphenated, space, 2nd one gone entirely, etc. Which makes it EXTREMELY difficult when trying to identify himself for things like boarding airplanes or getting PO boxes or ID cards. I guess if you're suuper careful and always pay super close attention when getting your documents for the first time, it might prevent the headache. In FH's case, his birth certificate, SS#, and passport were all created when he arrived in this country as a young child, and his parents obviously didn't pay that much attention (or probably even realize how important it would be down the road). Reply Lexy 12:39 pm on Mar. 7My mother didn't change her last name when she got married, but would often use her maiden name hypthenated with my dad's last name when it pertained to my sister and myself (school forms, etc. ), since we just have the same last name as our dad. The only problem with this is that she often forgets which name she has things listed under, her maiden name, my dad's last name, or the hyphenated combo. Now that I'm all grown up, I realize how cool it is that she kept her own name, but never got all offended or condescending if someone called her by my dad's last name. I intend to follow in her footsteps.19 agree Reply Evva 4:03 pm on Apr. 3I like this idea, too and was hoping to just do that – keep my name everywhere official but won't mind if people call me Mrs C. This is partly because I've gone through a name change twice (full name due to ridiculously religious Hindu family of the manipulative ex and again after divorce) and it is a great pain to do when you reside in UK but hold a Polish passport. The kids have my last name as their second middle name. Problem sorted Reply TJ 12:40 pm on Mar. 7My last name is Jolly and I LOVE IT! As for changing it? He never even thought to ask. Instead of hyphenating for possible children (because Jolly-Paleos sounds wretched), boys get his last name, girls get mine, and they get the other parent's name as a second middle name. *dusts off hands* Easy!5 agree Reply Astrid 1:09 pm on Mar. 7This is exactly what my husband and I have decided to do, minus the middle names thing.4 agree Reply Tony 1:02 pm on Mar. 14Do you have a plan in place for what you'll do if your kid is intersex or trans? I ask because I have a trans friend with a Jewish mother and a Christian father – the parents decided to raise the girls in their mother's religion and the boys in their father's religion. My friend has had some identity conflicts related to this choice, since he got raised in the \\\"girl\\\" religion. I can imagine something similar happening to a trans or intersex child (or any child really) who is given a last name based on their gender.3 agree Reply Rebecca 3:03 pm on Mar. 14That is a great question that I had not thought about at all…if intersex, I think we would let them choose, and if trans then they can change their name to the appropriate one–or pick a new one entirely. I have a sister who has no attachment to the name I love so much, so she goes by our mother's maiden name and plans on changing it legally. I love my name, but I have no illusions that anyone else does or should. (Also, I'm still holding out some hope that my husband will still change his name to mine. He's not averse to it…)6 agree Reply Stephanie S. 7:14 pm on Apr. 2cool last name! i've never heard of boys taking dad's last name and girls taking mom's.. To each his own.. it just sounds so gendered to me.. like separate families. Different last names in a family is totally cool, but purposefully doing it based on their sex? Is this a tradition I've never heard of?9 agree Reply Jess 12:41 am on Feb. 17I don't know of this being any specific tradition but I considered it the moment I realised that if my bf and I decide to get married, I might want to keep my last name. I love my last name. I'm an only child and no one else alive in my family, save for my parents, have it. I don't really want to get rid of it. Mixing names wouldn't work well. Hyphenating would be awkward, too. I already have two middle names, and our names don't really flow well together and in the one order, it'd make me sound like a road. (My last name's Lane. Also, I usually have to explain/spell about twice before people on the phone understand that it isn't Lang. )Anyway, having all the prospective kids have his last name didn't really seem fair. I still feel it wouldn't be quite fair if mine went to just the girls since then the name still wouldn't be carried on unless that child kept their name as well. Maybe we should mix it up.1 agrees Reply Eva-Lani 12:46 pm on Mar. 7Though hyphenated last names are awesome I chose to not hyphenate my last name when I got married for two important reasons. First my first name has a hyphen in it already. I thought it would just be too much of a good thing to have two hyphens. Second I was never given a middle name so I took the opportunity to have my old last name be moved to my middle name.2 agree Reply Anne-Marie 2:56 am on Mar. 9This is my reasoning too, I struggle for ages to come up with a solution that doesn't mean discarding my name but equally doesn't leave me with two hypenated names. (I'm not married yet.) Also, our last names are very similar – they're next to each other in tartan souvenir shops, ha – so it'd be an unwieldy hyphenation. There's also a tradition of having last names as middle names in my dad's family, though it's more generally that children are given the mother's maiden name as a middle name. We almost did this for our daughter, and I'm starting to wish we had now!The other reason (aside from the fact that I *like* my surname) for including both names/not discarding my surname involves our children – I have a daughter from a previous relationship who has my surname, and for various reasons (including practical ones, like when dealing with officialdom, eg customs, or medical staff) it seems like a good idea to keep that surname as part of my name somehow.1 agrees Reply Rachel H.

My compromise was dropping my middle name (which didn't have much significance) and replaced it with my maiden name.

So we decided to make a new name by mixing our names together. We worked it out and got a new name! We call each other by said name all the time.2 agree Reply Emily 12:56 pm on Mar. 7Thank you for this post! My fh and I are hyphenating our last names and it was a tough decision but I'm really happy with it. I'm so excited that the fh and I will have the same last name but that neither of us will be giving up our heritage. Both people gain and no one loses!But then there is the argument: what will your children do when they get married?! The horror! Well, they may have a tough decision, just like their parents did when they got married. They will figure it out and they may not get married at all. Thanks for giving me some ammo from a grown up hyphenated child to shoot at the naysayers.7 agree Reply Katie 1:01 pm on Mar. 7Thank you for the post! !I will be hyphenating my last name in just a few short months *SQUEEEEE!*. I came to this decision very easily for the following reasons.1) our last names sound great together 2) both of our last names are unique on their own so together I'm really going to have a one-of-a-kind name 3) Getting married at *almost* 30 means I've had a long time to establish myself with my name. I want to keep the name recognition I've developed over the years but also want to align myself with him in our new family. 4) I've always thought that hyphenated names were the shit The down side is (as my dad pointed out)… now I'll have two names that no one can pronounce just by looking at it. =P But I'm already used to spelling my name all the time so I think it will be no big deal to add a hyphen and 5 more letters to the mix. As far as the kids question… We'll probably just give his last name to our kids… but who knows! The children in question don't even exist yet.1 agrees Reply Leslie 1:11 pm on Mar. 7I have a slightly different perspective: When my spouse and I married in CA before Prop H8te, I took on a hyphenated name because: – After fifty years with my name, I really didn't want to lose my original last name, so taking on just my spouse's name wasn't an option, but – We're raising our grandkids and I have no relationship with them that's immediately legally recognized without pulling out all the paperwork, but by sharing a last name with them all I now have to say to pretty much ANYone (doctors, teachers, etc.) is \\\"I'm the grandmother\\\" and it's taken at face value where it wasn't before my name change, and – honestly, I just love shoving my MARRIED name in some people's faces, since I live in a county so conservative that 66% of the voters actually voted for Christine O'Donnell to be our Senator. I do find that more and more SOCIALLY I just use my family's shared last name and not the full hyphenated version, and there are many things about having a hyphenated last name that are truly a pain in the tuchus. But overall, I'm very pleased with my new last name. FYI, Spouse did not hyphenate. Instead, as someone who was never given a middle name at birth, my last name is now my spouse's legal middle name.7 agree Reply Shaina 1:29 pm on Mar. 7I think hyphenated names are great! My fiance and I are wondering what the hell we're going to do. He'd really prefer I take his name. He's more traditional. I for one love the name I was given.

I'm still trying to win him over. :p1 agrees Reply Offbeat Intern 4:16 pm on Mar. 7My parents were both academics and neither changed their name. They just hyphenated the children's name.1 agrees Reply Teffer 7:31 am on Mar. 8In Quebec, where I live, the woman always legally keeps her maiden name, so it's pretty standard practice that the kids get hyphenated names (at least, that's what my man's parents did. But they also gave him three first names. )But I'm excited to see what happens when my generation starts marrying and having babies. SOoo many names! !2 agree Reply Jaimie 2:22 am on Apr. 10My boyfriend and I had the name conversation. He wanted me to take his name (he's more traditional like that and really loves his adopted family's name) and I very firmly didn't want to lose mine (I love my family name). It was a bit of a problem at first because he wants our family to have the same name and after the mama-dram from losing his middle name to be replaced by his original last name in his adoption, there's no way he's changing his. I brought up hyphenating it but he rightly pointed out how unwieldy that would be with our three-syllables-each names (Anderson and Solomon. It doesn't help that they end so similarly). Also, we're in the Army, so our last names are constantly on display. Hyphenating our names would give us sixteen characters to have squeezed onto nameplates. Arg. Fortunately, my Mutti's family's naming traditions came to the rescue. In her family, you get your own first name and then three middle names: your same-sex parent's first name followed by your same-sex grandparents' first names (can't remember the order of those two). I decided to take a page out of her book and take my last name as a second middle name when we wed. But I'm keeping my last name as is for the army and answering to either elsewhere (just easier that way), though I'm not sure he knows about my plan yet. Replydonteatmenooo 1:30 pm on Mar. 7Ugh, but what do I do if I want us both to have the same last name, as well as our kids if we have any, but his name is perfect for him and mine for me?

(Get rid of the two Ys).10 agree Reply Kayla 1:36 pm on Mar. 7Not that I have anything against people who have one, but I *LOATHE* hyphenated last names. I don't know why. It's an inexplicable rage. Not towards the person, just the name. Maybe a hyphan slighted me in a past life, who knows. This became a problem for me, since I also loathe my last name. I use to dream of the day I could change it when I got married, as a little girl. It's only 5 letters, but only one person I've met, in my ENTIRE LIFE, could pronounce it correctly. One. So, of course, I'm going to marry him. Except he has a double-barreled last name. The irony! The horror!For a while, we flirted with just dropping half of it. I liked his father's surname more than his mother's, but imagining the drama fest that would result from her feeling slighted was not fun. So, we're going to 3rd option route of picking something completely different! He's cool with whatever I decide (it made no different to him if I took his name, he took mine, we only took half of his, we ditched the concept of last names altogether like Prince and Madonna, etc). The one we're considering the most is my maternal grandmother's father's original last name, before he americanized it to avoid getting kitchen/janitorial duty in the navy. I've always loved the sound of it, and it goes particularly well with the names we're considering for our future children.4 agree Reply KT 1:39 pm on Mar. 7Though I am not married/engaged/at a place in my life where these things are options, I am almost certainly taking my partner's last name. My last name is one letter off of the word \\\"fucks\\\" and I'm tired of people pronouncing it as such, and hyphenating it would probably be even more horrible (think about it). Also, though I love my dad, I have a strained relationship with his side of the family and I hate being tied to them with my last name. I'm all for preserving one's pre-married identity and all that but I've always hated my last name and changing it doesn't change who I am.2 agree Reply Dina 10:59 pm on Mar. 9Oooh, my grandfather had your surname. He ended up changing it to Fox because he was sick of it!2 agree Reply Olivia 2:01 pm on Mar. 7My last name begins with a G. My husband's last name begins with an M. When we got engaged, I knew that I wanted to acknowledge the idea of two becoming one with including his name, but because I'm a journalist and I have strong connections to my ancestry on my dad's side, I didn't want to give up my name in the process. I decided to hyphenate. The big surprise, however, happened when we got married in the Czech Republic. Per law and custom there, the husband's last name goes first when hyphenating. We didn't realize this until they told us at the ceremony. And then had to explain to the city councilwoman marrying us what was so funny about my having the initials OMG. It's my new moniker. (Sidebar: One of my favorite name changes is operatic soprano Measha Brueggergosman. She was born Measha Gosman but when she married a man whose last name is Bruegger, combined the two into one fluid and fantastic name. )5 agree Reply Liz 2:09 pm on Mar. 7Like so many women on here, I love my last name. I identify with it. It's very Italian and probably the last bit if Italian heritage I have. Plus it means Of Christmas in Italian…and my favorite holiday is Christmas…pretty nice bonus. Hubby didn't care that I didn't want to take his name. We're not planning on kids but if we do, I wouldn't mind if they had his name and not mine. I have yet to personally know anyone else who has kept their maiden name after marriage. I feel pretty alone in our little social network in that regard. At least I have the Tribe!Reply Rae Gross 2:25 pm on Mar. 7I also *LOVE* my last name! I didn't even know it until I got married – I felt like a part of my identity had been taken away from me. I wasn't \\\"one of the Gross girls (there are six of us). When I got a divorce and got my name back I swore never again! Plus my Dad converted to my Mom's faith, so I have a very Jewish name but wasn't raised Jewish. I love how much history my last name is and I can't imagine changing my name ever again.2 agree Reply Andrea M 2:26 pm on Mar. 7I actually have a painful REVERSE decision. If I hyphenate, I will have FIVE names and well, they just don't make enough space on paperwork for such names. So my choices are switch my last name (after I jumped through hoops in high school to get legally changed to my father's birth surname which he illegally changed via white out on his birth certificate) to Petersen, or drop my third name. My third name happens to be my mom's maiden name, and I am the last person in the US to have that family name. So it's either cut out a name I really like, or deny my heritage to make room for a hyphen. So far out of all the things in my wedding, this choice is by far the hardest.1 agrees Reply Rabbits Wife 2:52 pm on Mar. 7It could be worse. I have 11 names.

Aside from my mother (who took my father's last name) I'm the only Roach left. It certainly built character and gave me a thick skin growing up. By the time I was seven my standard response to the bug jokes was, \\\"WOW! That is so original!

It's actually part of the reason why I knew our relationship is \\\"The Real Deal\\\", because it made my struggle over whether to keep my maiden name when I got married completely disappear. That said, I'm going to keep my maiden name as a second middle name, because I love my middle name as well (and I've always wanted two middle names).

Mwahahaa!Reply Myndi 3:24 pm on Mar. 7when i tell people that we are both keeping our own last names EVERYONE always reccomends we hyphenate… the problem is that gives us to similar sounding/looking names together and it sounds terrible (both names are short and start with S and end with N)when we have children they will have my last name and his last name as a middle name. if they dont like it they can always choose to change it legally like i did1 agrees Reply Jenne 3:31 pm on Mar. 7I love my fiance's last name, although he hates it. He would never change it though – just a rogue branch of the family that causes issues occaionally. Changing to my name isn't an option – it's my ex-husband's name, so THAT'S not going to happen LOL! I kept it because of my daughter – ease with schools and everything (although fiance gets \\\"assigned\\\" my daughter's last name because the school system isn't set up to recognize that he has a different name). Annoying!Anyway, I was talking to a friend of mine who convinced me to hyphenate. She said you can use whichever name you want, whenever you want. I love my middle name – my grandmothers were Anne & Anna, my mother's middle name is Ann and so is mine. (Coincidentally, both my grandfathers were Frank, so is my dad, so guess what my brother's middle name is? )I have a friend who has gone through 5 last names in the last 12 years – maiden, 1st marriage, 2nd marriage, new last name entirely, 3rd marriage (now ending). I told her after her new last name entirely that I was not changing her last name in my address list because I couldn't find her!

It's much shorter, and easier to spell. We do plan on having kids, and though I think it's manageable to hyphenate, I just think it will be simpler. I've gotten a lot of \\\"okay, but you know a last name doesn't make a family right?\\\" Yes – and changing my name doesn't mean I have to stop being a feminist, either. And whatever we do with our names doesn't really define our relationship – we do. I actually spoke to my ob/gyn today about it, and she kept her name. When she and her husband had kids, one kid got his name and one got hers – kind of cool! I may move my maiden name to my middle name and it would make a kick-ass middle name for a kid, too.

I also teach high school, so you can see why I want to change it. 2)My guy created a brand new last name when he changed his name, and I want to be the originator of a last name. 2 very good reasons in my mind.1 agrees Reply Jess 5:19 pm on Mar. 7Not married yet, my last name is hyphenated as are my siblings, my parents (still married 25ish years) do not have hyphenated names. I know my SO and i will be getting married and I'm dreading having to choose what name I'm going to take/keep. Its my name, it is my siblings names (we all have the same first initial so they're going to have to be creative with their email address selection for work in the future muahaha) sometimes it is the only thing we have in common. I won't be hyphenating all three… the two are already too long Reply Mari Fee 5:44 pm on Mar. 7 (To avoid confusion, Mari Fee is a pen name)I'm fairly sure I'll keep my own last name and not hyphenate (it doesn't roll off the tongue hyphenated), but the fiance and I are debating combining our names – to Proton. He'd be Jonny Proton, and that's just hilarious.4 agree Reply Je Nee 10:33 am on Oct. 17I could be Photon. ..or Bolips…Phibon.. The random combination of our last names make me laugh. I will likely take his name, because I have no sentimental attachments to the surname I was born with. Reply Linda 6:08 pm on Mar. 7I love this article. It helps to solidify how I'm going to address the whole \\\"last name thing\\\" next month when I get married. I was married once before and took his last name. As soon as we divorced I went back to my original last name and swore I would never change it again. My now soon-to-be-hubby is so fantastic and has agreed to let me do what I wish when it comes to my name. I would love to take his name because of what he means to me, but I still can't let go of mine. So, I've decided to combine them by hyphenating them…but not your typical way. My last name is Novak and his is Mattson, so once we've said \\\"I do\\\" I will become Linda Mattson-Novak (instead of Novak-Mattson so my initials will be LMN!!!)! It makes me giggle everytime I think about it! and this way I am embracing my new family but my family is still the anchor!Reply Cal 6:34 pm on Mar. 7Thank you for sticking up for the hyphenated kids! My parents gave me and my brother hyphenated last names and kept their own. People always tell me that it was a nice gesture, but that my parents had no forethought – what did they think I was going to name my kids? I think they probably thought I could decide that for myself if I ever had kids! They made the decision that was right for them (not a \\\"gesture\\\"), and my soon to be wife and I will make the decision that's right for us. They'll probably get my name, which is both the most conventional (getting the father's name) and the least (getting a hyphenated name, especially one that's not Mother-Father). Then they'll decide what to do if/when they have kids. What a crazy idea.4 agree Reply Offbeat Intern 6:48 pm on Mar. 7Power to us hyphenated-kids!! Glad to meet others who love their name! !Also – WTF. I know I've been getting it my whole life, but the whole 'what to do with kids' thing is just so baffling … but I digress.1 agrees Reply Caitlin 1:43 am on Jun. 21My fiancé and I have decided to do what your parents did (keep our names, kids are hyphenated) and I've had so many people pull the \\\"but what will your kids call their kids?!?\\\" line. I would be super mad if someone told me what I had to do with my name, so why would I make that decision for my (currently theoretical) kids who may or may not even want children. Cart before horse much? Reply Claire 6:39 pm on Mar. 7My dad taught me how to write my signature and as a result I write my \\\"y's\\\" exactly like him. I didn't want to give that up, and my husband and I both decided we didn't want to hyphenate. We decided to combine names. As in, if he was Smith and I was Johnson, we would become Smohnson. We've had amazingly positive reactions to it, and I got to keep my \\\"y\\\".1 agrees Reply Laraine 6:52 pm on Mar. 7What are the legal ramifications to different name options? I think I want my mother's name (von Dobeneck) or his mother's name (Mullany). (I like them better than either of our father's names)I like being the only Laraine Weschler in the whole wide internet, but I'd still be unique as Laraine von Dobeneck or Laraine Mullany. Reply Offbeat Intern 7:12 pm on Mar. 7I do have a secret. I was actually born Rebecca Miller Webster (Miller was my middle name). My mom didn't change her name and got annoyed at being called Mrs. Webster, so they decided to hyphenate (long before I have any memories). A lawyer advised them that it is really difficult to change a child's name and they could call me whatever they wanted. And they did – I was enrolled in school and got a driver's license and a ss# with the hyphenated name. It was only when I went to get a passport that they put the name on my birth certificate, so when I was 18 I legally changed it to the only name I've ever known. Anyway, the process differs from state to state. Usually you have to file docs with the court (I did this all without a lawyer) and then put a notice in a local paper for X amount of time. Then I went in front of a judge and he was like \\\"um why are you changing your name? uh ok.\\\"Once you've legally changed your name — which is easier upon marriage — you go to the DMV and SS etc etc and apply for new docs. On certain things – loans, credit apps, etc – they'll ask you if you've ever been know by a different name or your maiden name. In other words, I don't think there's much of a legal ramification. It's a pain, but people do it all the time. Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer.1 agrees Replymel 10:17 pm on Mar. 7No way! You are exactly like me!I also have a hyphenated name, which I love love love. Like someone above said, thanks for speaking up for the happily hyphenated kids. And the whole \\\"what about your kids\\\" things really annoys me as well. I mean, most people choose one name out of 2 to name their kids, I'll just have to choose 1 or 2 among 3! It's not so different. But, like you, I have a secret. My Mom's name is actually my middle name, but I use both names is my day to day life, hyphenated. (That's how much I love hyphens!) It's a problem because I never remember what name I'm under for different things. I'm jealous you got your social insurence number and driver's licence in your hyphenated name, mine isn't and it makes me sad. I'm also thinking of legally changing it, but it seems like a lot of money/hassle to simply turn my middle into half my last name…1 agrees Reply Offbeat Intern 10:38 am on Mar. 8Honestly, legally changing it really wasn't that bad and it makes me SO HAPPY that my name is my legal name. It's probably worth looking into what's required — I'm sure it's on a website somewhere.2 agree Reply Carlene 6:57 pm on Mar. 7I went through a long process of legally changing my name (including birth certificate, high school diploma, etc…) from my abusive father's to my momma's last name quite recently. After waiting so long to actually get the last name that I now have, I really don't want to just throw it away when I get married. Plus, after getting my degree and my (new) last name on that…So, I've decided I'm either keeping my name or we can both hyphenate (even though both of our names are pretty long to begin with)… plus, both of our last names our really Celtic so it's kinda funny.. Replymighty_stiky 7:51 pm on Mar. 7I decided pretty quickly that I am going to hyphenate (even though it'll result in a really long surname). The thing that surprised me, though, was that my fiancÃ© was actually considering doing the same thing. The only problem is if he wanted to change his name he'd have to pay an insane amount of money and tackle the byzantine court system due to Minnesota not having equal name change laws for both sexes. I find that kind of sucky, but until the pressure is applied to allow greater flexibility, I don't think it will change in my lifetime. That said, I already think of myself with the hyphenated name. We're not having kids, so it doesn't really matter what either one of us do. (That said, I'm kind of tickled that my fiancÃ© is at least somewhat open to taking on the same last name I'll have. )Reply Baronessa R 9:33 pm on Mar. 7I'm signing myself up for a lifetime of headache. For whatever reason, I just don't like the look of hyphenated surnames. I also love my middle name and would never replace it. So if I want a double barreled last name (and I do), it has to be sans hyphen. But hey, if it works for Helena Bonham Carter it can work for me, right? Reply Lily Mc Carthy 12:30 am on Mar. 8My parent's never married, so the girls in the family got the mother's name, and boys got the father's. I always wanted a hyphenated name, only my beau has a very similar sounding name to mine. Lily Mc Carthy-Mc Dowall would just sound stupid Reply Andrew Snowball 2:09 am on Mar. 8Interested to read that nobody forgets your surname when it's a hyphenated (double barrel) surname. People always remember my surname being \\\"Snowball\\\". I have to grit my teeth and smile each Christmas as every shop assistant reels out the jokes I have heard a hundred times! However it is good for business contacts, they remember you. If my wife and I had double up we would have been Snowball-Reeves or Reeves-Snowball…Mmm not sure Reply Sarah 2:52 am on Mar. 8My google doppelganger is a porn star. I definitely need to hyphenate.1 agrees Reply Offbeat Intern 10:38 am on Mar. 8Haha! My husband's a sex offender – a teacher who slept with a student. Hilarious!Reply Princess K 3:34 am on Mar. 8My first name starts with a K, so does my surname and so does his surname…..which would make my initials KKK Hyphenating is out of the question!Reply Kelly Orozco-Taganas 3:34 am on Mar. 8Not sure if people would consider my husband's and I respective surnames ethnic, but they're certainly unusual. Which means we've had to endure a life of mispronounced surnames. Going into our marriage, I had no professional career or brand built around my maiden name. Yet, it was a huge part of my identity and I felt that despite a lack of career, my choice to keep my maiden shouldn't be marginalized or belittled. My husband would have preferred I take on his last name, but in the end supported any decision I made. I ultimately decided to hyphenate our names, my mom thought it was weird and I'm not sure his family understands. Either way, I'm fine with my new 13 letter new last name (even though its a pain now to fill out paperwork). If we ever do have kids, we've discussed continuing the Hispanic/Filipino tradition of adding the mother's surname to our future kids name.1 agrees Reply Tess Hawe 5:11 am on Mar. 8I've been having a bit of a struggle as to changing/keeping/hyphenating my last name when I marry my h2b. My last name has always caused me a bit of grief, especially at school as although it is spelt Hawe it is pronounced wh**re!! I do love my name and I'm very attatched to it, it can be an awesome conversation starter. As the youngest of three girls with no brothers I feel a bit inclined to carry on the family name. Hyphenating both our names would be ok if it wasn't for the fact that it would be Forder-Hawe (afford-a-wh**re!) I deffinatly want us to both have the same surname but I don't really know how to do it without sacrificing my name or us both sounding a bit silly : SReply Ashley 5:46 am on Mar. 8I think for me, it's a few things. I'm changing my last name when I get married and just taking my husband's. For one, I'll admit, I like simplicity. I also am still keeping my first and middle name, so really, even if I considered my name an intrigal part of my personality, I still have 2/3 of it. Besides – I've had my last name since I was born…I'd like to try a new one on. I'd say the only way I would keep my last name after marriage is if I had already built a name for myself as an Illustrator. But I am not yet world famous, so I will become such with my new lsat name! =)1 agrees Reply Gloria 7:13 am on Mar. 8I'm from Spain, so that's not a problem here. When a couple gets married, each spouse keeps his/her name, with consist in a name and two surnames, as the kids always get their father's first, then their mother's first. So, Jane Smith Jones marries John Watson Miller, and that makes their kid Penny Watson Smith. The family is also adressed as \\\"The Watson-Smith Family\\\". Pretty cool if you ask me, and it takes away a lot of the complications… x)Reply Offbeat Intern 10:40 am on Mar. 8I actually had a bit about naming traditions in Spain originally in the post! We cut it for length and flow, but I always bust out Spain as an example when people tell me it's SO WEIRD. Since I'm a tid-bit Spanish, I like to think that it's my tradition too – even though I know it had nothing to do with it.

It is one of the smallest in the LAND CRUISER family, and was created as a light-duty alternative to its heavier and rougher siblings in the 1980s. Over time, the PRADO became the preferred model for those who wanted the ruggedness of the LAND CRUISER in a smaller and relatively more affordable package.
